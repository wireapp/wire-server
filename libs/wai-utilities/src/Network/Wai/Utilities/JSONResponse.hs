-- Both static and dynamic errors are converted to this type before being
-- turned into HTTP responses. It is a generalisation of 'Wai.Error',
-- encompassing both standard error values (including @label@, @code@ and
-- @message@ fields), and custom error-like responses that include extra data
-- for the clients.
