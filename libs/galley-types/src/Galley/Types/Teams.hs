-- Note [whitelist events]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- When a service is put off the whitelist, we want to notify users about
-- this so that they would be able to update their whitelists in real time
-- (or at least this could be useful for the team admin console). For this
-- we might eventually have events 'ServiceWhitelistAdd' and
-- 'ServiceWhitelistRemove'.
--
-- However, they're not really necessary for clients, and currently
-- implementing them is problematic. There are three choices and all are
-- bad:
--
--   1. If we decide to send them to all users, this would be an expensive
--      operation â€“ especially once we have bigger teams. We can send these
--      events asynchonously, but it's still somewhat painful.
--
--   2. If we decide to only send them to e.g. team admins, now we have to
--      figure out who *are* team admins, and currently the backend doesn't
--      have a notion of a team admin at all. See Note [team roles].
--
--   3. We could create a new permission (e.g. "CanWhitelistServices") and
--      only send the event to users with this permission, because
--      presumably only they care about it. However, we can't do this
--      either, because adding new permissions is tricky.
--      See Note [team roles] again.
--
-- So, we don't send these events at all. An implementation was done, but
-- then removed in commit b4d777ede1c7f73e42b2e1bc356ce7346e0355bc.
--
-- It's also unclear whether these event types belong in Brig or in Galley;
-- arguably the code would be simpler if they were in Brig, so we should
-- think about that if we want to get them in.

-- Note [hidden team roles]
--
-- The problem: the mapping between 'Role' and 'Permissions' is fixed by external contracts:
-- client apps treat permission bit matrices as opaque role identifiers, so if we add new
-- permission flags, things will break there.
--
-- The solution: add new permission bits to 'HiddenPerm', 'HiddenPermissions', and make
-- 'hasPermission', 'mayGrantPermission' polymorphic.  Now you can check both for the hidden
-- permission bits and the old ones that we share with the client apps.

-- Note [team roles]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Client apps have a notion of *team roles*. They are defined as sets of
-- permissions:
--
--     member =
--         {AddRemoveConvMember, Create/DeleteConversation,
--         GetMemberPermissions, GetTeamConversations}
--
--     admin = member +
--         {Add/RemoveTeamMember, SetMemberPermissions, SetTeamData}
--
--     owner = admin +
--         {DeleteTeam, Get/SetBilling}
--
-- For instance, here: https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/blob/dev/app/script/team/TeamPermission.js
--
-- Whenever a user has one of those specific sets of permissions, they are
-- considered a member/admin/owner and the client treats them accordingly
-- (e.g. for an admin it might show a certain button, while for an ordinary
-- user it won't).
--
-- On the backend, however, we don't have such a notion. Instead we have
-- granular (in fact, probably *too* granular) permission masks. Look at
-- 'Perm' and 'Permissions'.
--
-- Admins as a concept don't exist at all, and team owners are defined as
-- "full bitmask". When we do checks like "the backend must not let the last
-- team owner leave the team", this is what we test for. We also never test
-- for "team admin", and instead look at specific permissions.
--
-- Creating a new permission flag is thus very tricky, because if we decide
-- that all team admins must have this new permission, we will have to
-- identify all existing team admins. And if it turns out that some users
-- don't fit into one of those three team roles, we're screwed.
