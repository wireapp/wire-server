-- | 'x5' must only be used for idempotent queries, or for cases
-- when a duplicate write has no severe consequences in
-- the context of the application's data model.
-- For more info see e.g.

-- The eager retry policy permits 5 retries with exponential
-- backoff (base-2) with an initial delay of 100ms, i.e. the
-- retries will be performed with 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms
-- and 1.6s delay, respectively, for a maximum delay of ~3s.
