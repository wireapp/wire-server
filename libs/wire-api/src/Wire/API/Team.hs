-- | How a team "binds" its members (users)
--
-- A `Binding` team is the normal team which we see in the UI. A user is
-- on-boarded as part of the team. If the team gets deleted/suspended the user
-- gets deleted/suspended.
--
-- A `NonBinding` team is a concept only in the backend. It is a team someone
-- can create and someone who has an account on Wire can join that team. This
-- way, in theory, one person can join many teams. This concept never made it as
-- a concept of product, but got used a lot of writing integration tests. Newer
-- features don't really work well with this and sometimes we have to rewrite
-- parts of the tests to use `Binding` teams.
--
-- Please try to not use `NonBinding` teams in tests anymore. In future, we
-- would like it to be deleted, but it is hard to delete because it requires a
-- bunch of tests to be rewritten.
