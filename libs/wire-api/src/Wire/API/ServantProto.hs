-- | We do not use 'Data.ProtocolBuffers.Decode' so we get a little freedom in
-- defining separate data types which match one to one with the protobuf and the
-- data types which we actually use in business logic. Eventually we should
-- think of better ways of doing this, perhaps using mu-schema or proto-lens as
-- it is fairly difficult to keep our custom data type, e.g. in
-- Wire.API.Message.Proto in sync with the proto files.
