-- Note [team roles]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Client apps have a notion of *team roles*. They are defined as sets of
-- permissions:
--
--     member =
--         {AddRemoveConvMember, Create/DeleteConversation,
--         GetMemberPermissions, GetTeamConversations}
--
--     admin = member +
--         {Add/RemoveTeamMember, SetMemberPermissions, SetTeamData}
--
--     owner = admin +
--         {DeleteTeam, Get/SetBilling}
--
-- For instance, here: https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/blob/dev/app/script/team/TeamPermission.js
--
-- Whenever a user has one of those specific sets of permissions, they are
-- considered a member/admin/owner and the client treats them accordingly
-- (e.g. for an admin it might show a certain button, while for an ordinary
-- user it won't).
--
-- On the backend, however, we don't have such a notion. Instead we have
-- granular (in fact, probably *too* granular) permission masks. Look at
-- 'Perm' and 'Permissions'.
--
-- Admins as a concept don't exist at all, and team owners are defined as
-- "full bitmask". When we do checks like "the backend must not let the last
-- team owner leave the team", this is what we test for. We also never test
-- for "team admin", and instead look at specific permissions.
--
-- Creating a new permission flag is thus very tricky, because if we decide
-- that all team admins must have this new permission, we will have to
-- identify all existing team admins. And if it turns out that some users
-- don't fit into one of those three team roles, we're screwed.

-- | Team-level role.  Analog to conversation-level 'ConversationRole'.
