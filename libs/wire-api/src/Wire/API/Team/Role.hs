-- Note [team roles]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- Client apps have a notion of *team roles*. They are defined as sets of
-- permissions:
--
--     member =
--         {AddRemoveConvMember, Create/DeleteConversation,
--         GetMemberPermissions, GetTeamConversations}
--
--     admin = member +
--         {Add/RemoveTeamMember, SetMemberPermissions, SetTeamData}
--
--     owner = admin +
--         {DeleteTeam, Get/SetBilling}
--
-- Whenever a user has one of those specific sets of permissions, they are
-- considered a member/admin/owner and the client treats them accordingly
-- (e.g. for an admin it might show a certain button, while for an ordinary
-- user it won't).
--
-- On the backend, however, we don't have such a notion. Instead we have
-- granular (in fact, probably *too* granular) permission masks. Look at
-- 'Perm' and 'Permissions'.
--
-- Admins as a concept don't exist at all, and team owners are defined as
-- "full bitmask". When we do checks like "the backend must not let the last
-- team owner leave the team", this is what we test for. We also never test
-- for "team admin", and instead look at specific permissions.
--
-- Creating a new permission flag is thus very tricky, because if we decide
-- that all team admins must have this new permission, we will have to
-- identify all existing team admins. And if it turns out that some users
-- don't fit into one of those three team roles, we're screwed.
--
-- SOLUTION: we introduce 'HiddenPerm' and 'HiddenPermissions', map
-- (non-hidden) -- permission masks to roles and roles to permissions (both
-- hidden and non-hidden), and provide a type class 'IsPerm' that handles
-- both hidden and non-hidden permissions uniformly.  We still cannot update
-- 'Perms' and 'Permissions', but we can introduce new HiddenPermissions and
-- associate them with roles.

-- | Team-level role.  Analog to conversation-level 'ConversationRole'.
