-- Note [hidden team roles]
--
-- The problem: the mapping between 'Role' and 'Permissions' is fixed by external contracts:
-- client apps treat permission bit matrices as opaque role identifiers, so if we add new
-- permission flags, things will break there.
--
-- "Hidden" in "HiddenPerm", therefore, refers to a permission hidden from
-- clients, thereby making it internal to the backend.
--
-- The solution: add new permission bits to 'HiddenPerm', 'HiddenPermissions', and make
-- 'hasPermission', 'mayGrantPermission' polymorphic.  Now you can check both for the hidden
-- permission bits and the old ones that we share with the client apps.
