-- | FUTUREWORK(fisx): (1) the verb could be added to the swagger docs in the appropriate
-- place here; it's always defined in the `Summary`, but the `RawM` doesn't allow to constrain
-- it.  (2) there should be a way to make this more type-safe: `assertMethod` in
-- "Proxy.API.Public" could take a type-level string literal argument containing the method,
-- and that argument could be funnelled there from the routing table somehow: `"spotify" :>
-- "api" :> "token" :> OnlyMethod "POST" :> RawM`, and then the `ServerT` instance for
-- `OnlyMethod` requires a proxy argument in the handler of the same type.  Or something.  (am
-- i massifly over-engineering things here?)
