Implement SCIM PATCH operations using aeson-diff library.

This change implements the core validation and application logic for SCIM PATCH operations that were previously stubbed:

- Implemented `isLegalPatchOp` and `operationIsLegal` to validate patch operations
  - Only Add, Remove (Rem), and Replace (Rep) operations are supported
  - Operations referencing array indices are rejected
  - Move, Copy, and Test operations are rejected as unsupported
- Implemented `applyPatch` function to apply patches to SCIM resources
  - Validates operations before applying
  - Converts resources to JSON, applies aeson-diff patch, and parses back
  - Maps aeson-diff errors to appropriate SCIM error responses (InvalidPath, InvalidValue)
- Added `applyPatch` export from Web.Scim.Schema.User module
- Conservative implementation: multi-valued attribute operations are rejected

Known limitations (marked FUTUREWORK):
- Multi-valued attributes and array operations are not supported
- Value-path filters (e.g., "emails[type eq 'work']") are not supported
- Immutability checks for 'id' and 'meta' fields are not yet implemented
- These limitations are documented in code comments and test stubs

This implementation prioritizes correctness and follows SCIM RFC 7644 section 3.5.2 for basic PATCH semantics.
