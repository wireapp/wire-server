-- | Like 'ReqBody'', but takes parsers that throw 'ServerError', not 'String'.  @tag@ is used
-- to select a 'MakeCustomError' instance.
--
-- FUTUREWORK: this does not reflect the changes we make to the error responses wrt. the
-- 'ReqBody'' instance.  however, in order to fix that, we would need to get more information
-- out of the 'MakeCustomError' instance and into 'ReqBodyCustomError''. Perhaps something
-- like @data ReqBody (mods :: [*]) (headers :: ...) (status :: ...) (list :: [ct]) (tag ::
-- Symbol) (a :: *)@.  and then we'll trip over issues similar to this one:
-- https://github.com/wireapp/servant-uverb/blob/3647c488a88137d3ec2583b518bda59ee7072278/servant-uverb/src/Servant/API/UVerb.hs#L33-L57
--
-- FUTUREWORK: this approach is not ideal because it makes it hard to avoid orphan instances.
--
-- FUTUREWORK: parser failures currently can't have custom monad effects like logging, since
-- they are run inside 'DelayedIO'.  we can either work around this by writing a middleware
-- that inspects the response and logs conditionally what it finds in the body (bad for
-- streaming and performance!), or re-wire more of the servant internals (unclear how hard
-- that'll be).
