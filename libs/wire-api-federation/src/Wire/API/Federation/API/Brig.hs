-- NOTE: ConversationId for remote connections
--
-- The plan is to model the connect/one2one conversationId as deterministically derived from
-- the combination of both userIds and both domains. It may be in the domain
-- of the sending OR the receiving backend (with a 50/50 probability).
-- However at the level of the federation API, we are only concerned about
-- the question of which backend has the authority over the conversationId.
--
-- (Backend A should not prescribe backend B to use a certain UUID for its
-- conversation; as that could lead to a potential malicious override of an
-- existing conversation)
--
-- The deterministic conversation Id should be seen as a 'best effort'
-- attempt only. (we cannot guarantee a backend won't change the code in the
-- future)
