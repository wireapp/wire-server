-- | Map federation errors to client-facing errors.
--
-- This module contains most of the error-mapping logic that turns the various
-- possible errors that can occur while making a federated request into errors
-- that are meaningful for the clients.
--
-- There are three types of errors, from lowest level to highest:
--
--  * 'FederatorClientHTTP2Error': this is thrown when something fails while
--     connecting or making a request to the local federator.
--  * 'FederatorClientError': this is the most common type of error,
--     corresponding to a failure at the level of the federator client. It
--     includes, for example, a failure to reach a remote federator, or an
--     error on the remote side.
--  * 'FederatorError': this is created by users of the federator client. It
--     can either wrap a 'FederatorClientError', or be an error that is outside
--     the scope of the client, such as when a federated request succeeds with
--     an unexpected result.
--
-- A general federated request is normally performed as a chain of HTTP
-- requests (some of which are HTTP2). Errors can occur at each node of the
-- chain, as well as in the communication between two adjacent nodes. A
-- successful request goes through the following stages:
--
--  1) a service (say brig) makes a request to (the outward service of) the
--     local federator (HTTP2);
--  2) the local federator processes this request;
--  3) the local federator makes a request to (the inward service of) a remote
--     one (HTTP2);
--  4) the remote federator processes this request;
--  5) from the remote federator to a service on that backend (HTTP);
--  6) the remote service processes this request.
--
-- Failures at step 1 in the chain result in 'FederatorClientHTTP2Error', while
-- any other failure results in a 'FederatorClientError'.
--
-- Immediate failures in the outward service of a federator (stage 2) result in
-- a 403 status code being returned to the federator client, which is then
-- translated into an error with label federation-local-error.
--
-- Failures which occurred while making a request to a remote federator (stages
-- 3 to 6) are turned into 5xx errors by federator itself, and then passed on
-- through without any further mapping. This includes issues in stage 4,
-- which are seen by the local federator as 403 status codes returned by the
-- remote, as well as arbitrary error codes returned by a service.
--
-- Note that the federation API follows the convention that any error should be
-- returned as part of a successful response with status code 200. Therefore any
-- error response from services during a federated call should be considered a bug
-- in the implementation of the federation API, and is therefore wrapped in a 533.

    -- cannot be parsed by the servant machinery (e.g. its content type is
    -- malformed or unsupported).

  | -- | This error will be thrown when federator returns an error response.

    -- by federator, or when negotiation fails because no common version could
    -- be found.
