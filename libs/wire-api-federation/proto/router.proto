// These definitions are part of the federation protocol.

// 1. A component (e.g. 'brig') will send some data of type 'FederatedRequest' to
// the 'federator' server (more precisely: the 'Outward' service part of the federator) within a same private network.
// 2. The federator will use the domain from the 'FederatedRequest' to discover
// where to send some data of type 'Request' to.
// 3. On the other side, a publicly exposed 'Inward' service (also co-hosted on the
// federator) will turn the received 'Request' into a 'Response' by making a call to a
// component (e.g. brig) on its private network.
