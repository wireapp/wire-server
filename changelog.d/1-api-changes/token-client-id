The `/access` endpoint now takes an optional `client_id` query parameter. The first time it is provided, a new user token will be generated containing the given client ID. Successive invocations of `/access` will ignore the `client_id` parameter. Some endpoints can now potentially require a client ID as part of the access token. When trying to invoke them with an access token that does not contain a client ID, an authentication error will occur.
