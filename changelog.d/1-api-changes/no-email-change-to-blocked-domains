The blocked domains feature
(`optSettings.setCustomerExtensions.domainsBlockedForRegistration`) is now
stricter: It is not only forbidden to register users with these domains in
their email addresses, but also to change a user's email address to one of
these domains.

This affects the endpoints:
- `/register` (as before)
- `/activate/send`
- `/users/{uid}/email`
- `/i/self/email` (internal endpoint)
- `/access/self/email`
- `/i/teams/{tid}/invitations` (internal endpoint)
- `/teams/{tid}/invitations`
