POST /scim/auth-token request body allows you to choose an IdP UUID to associate with.  If none is given, do not associate.

**WARNING:** the new behavior differs from the old one when first creating a unique SAML IdP and then the SCIM token: before this release, this request would associate the two, now it doesn't.
