Start version 2 of the public API. Main changes:

 - Asset endpoints have lost their `v3` and `v4` suffixes. So for example
   `/assets/v3` has been replaced by `/assets`.
 - `GET /conversations/:conv/assets/:id` and `GET
   /conversations/:conv/otr/assets/:id` have been removed.
 - `GET /assets/:key/v3` has been removed. Use the qualified endpoint `GET
   /assets/:domain/:key` instead.
 - `DELETE /assets/:key/v3` has been removed. Use the qualified endpoint
   `DELETE /assets/:domain/:key` instead.
 - `GET /connections` has been removed. Use `POST /list-connections` instead.
 - `POST /connections` has been removed. Use `POST /connections/:domain/:user` instead.
 - `PUT /connections/:domain/:user` has been removed: use `POST` instead.
 - `GET /conversations` has been removed. Use `POST /conversations/list-ids`
   followed by `POST /conversations/list` instead.
 - `POST /conversations/list/v2` has been replaced by `POST
   /conversations/list`.
 - `POST /conversations/:domain/:conv/members/v2` has lost its `v2` suffix, so
   it is now `POST /conversations/:domain/:conv/members`.
 - `GET /users`, `GET /users/by-handle` and `GET /users/handles` have been
   removed. Use `POST /search/contacts` instead.
 - `GET /users/:id` has been removed. Use the qualified endpoint `GET
   /users/:domain/:id` instead.
 - `GET /users/:id/clients` has been removed. Use the qualified endpoint `GET
   /users/:domain/:id/clients` instead.
 - `GET /users/:id/clients/:client` has been removed. Use the qualified
   endpoint `GET /users/:domain/:id/clients/:client` instead.
