The new endpoint `/calls/config/authenticated` returns the same data as
`/calls/config/v2` and in addition features a new optional field `is_federating`
which reflects whether SFT federation is enabled or not. Also, the new optional
fields `username` and `credential` in the `sft_servers_all` object of the
endpoint's response provide the SFT credential which the authenticated client
should use for connecting to SFT. The credential will only be generated if a
secret shared between SFT and Brig has been configured for Brig. Repeated calls
to the endpoint will not lead to newly issued SFT credentials until a configured
timespan has been elapsed. During this timespan, the already provided SFT
credential will be replayed in the endpoint's response. For this to work,
clients have to send the `Z-Client` header in their requests to this new
endpoint.
