User objects have gained a `supported_protocols` field. Users can set it to any subset of `["proteus", "mls"]` using `PUT /self/supported-protocols`. There is also a new endpoint `GET /users/:domain/:id/supported-protocols`. The backend does not assign any semantics to this field, but it is intended to be used to coordinate migration to MLS across the clients of a user, as well as between two users participating in a 1-1 conversation.
