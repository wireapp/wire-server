From API version V9 on, the `POST /domain-verification/{domain}/backend` and
`POST /get-domain-registration` endpoints are adjusted to also carry the
`webapp_url` in their payloads. The structure of these payloads changes as
well: The former `backend_url` and the new `webapp_url` are now combined in one
object in the `backend` field:

```json
{
...
  "backend": {
    "config_url": "{url}",
    "webapp_url": "{url}"
  }
}
```
