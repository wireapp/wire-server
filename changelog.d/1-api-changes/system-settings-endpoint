`GET /system/settings/unauthorized` returns a curated set of system settings from brig. The endpoint is reachable without authentication/authorization. It's meant to be used by apps to adjust their behavior (e.g. to show a registration dialog if registrations are enabled on the backend.) Currently, only the `setRestrictUserCreation` flag is exported. Other options may be added in future (in consultation with the security department.)
