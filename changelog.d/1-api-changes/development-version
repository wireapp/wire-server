A new field `development` has been added to the object returned by `GET
/api-version`. Versions listed there are considered in flux, meaning that the
corresponding API contracts can change arbitrarily over time. Clients are free
to use development versions, as long as they are also listed in `supported`,
and failures due to incompatibilities are acceptable (e.g. in testing
environments). Backends are the authoritative source on whether a development
version can be used at all. If a development version should not be used, the
backend will not list it among the supported versions at all.
