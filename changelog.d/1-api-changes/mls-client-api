The client JSON object now has an additional field `mls_public_keys`, containing an object mapping signature schemes to public keys, e.g.
```
{
  ...
  "mls_public_keys": { "ed25519": "GY+t1EQu0Zsm0r/zrm6zz9UpjPcAPyT5i8L1iaY3ypM=" }
  ...
}
```
At the moment, `ed25519` is the only supported signature scheme, corresponding to MLS ciphersuite 1.

When creating a new client with `POST /clients`, the field `mls_public_keys` can be set, and the corresponding public keys are bound to the device identity on the backend, and will be used to veriy uploaded key packages with a matching signature scheme.

When updating a client with `PUT /clients/:client`, the field `mls_public_keys` can also be set, with a similar effect. If a given signature scheme already has a public key set for that device, the request will fail.
