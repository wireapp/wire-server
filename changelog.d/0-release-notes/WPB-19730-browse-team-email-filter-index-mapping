Elasticsearch/OpenSearch mapping updated for team user search to support filtering by unverified email addresses. For the new filter `email=verified|unverified` on `GET /teams/{tid}/search` to work as intended, it is necessary to create a new index and re-index the data either by [migrating to a new index](https://docs.wire.com/latest/developer/reference/elastic-search.html?h=#migrate-to-a-new-index) or by [recreating the index](https://docs.wire.com/latest/developer/reference/elastic-search.html?h=#recreate-an-index-requires-downtime).
