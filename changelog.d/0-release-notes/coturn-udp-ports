For users of the (currently alpha) coturn Helm chart:
**manual intervention may be required** when upgrading to
this version of the chart from a prior version, due to [a bug in
Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/39188) which
may interfere with applying changes to pod and service port configuration
correctly.

If, after updating this chart, the coturn pods do not have both a `coturn-udp`
port and a `coturn-tcp` port, then the coturn `StatefulSet` must be manually
deleted from the cluster, and then recreated by re-running Helm. Similarly, if
the coturn `Service` does not have both a `coturn-udp` port and a `coturn-tcp`
port, this `Service` must also be deleted and recreated.
