New field for Supported protocols in Galley's MLS feature config

Galley will refuse to start if the list `supportedProtocols` does not contain
the value of the field `defaultProtocol`. Galley will also refuse to start if
MLS migration is enabled and MLS is not part of `supportedProtocols`.

The default value for `supportedProtocols` is:
```
[proteus, mls]
```
