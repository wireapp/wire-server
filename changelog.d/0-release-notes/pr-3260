**Federation only**

From this release on, remote connections can be configured via an
internal REST API; the remote connections configured in the
values.yaml file(s) will be honored for a transition period, but will
be ignored starting in some future release.

YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR BRIG HELM VALUES BEFORE DEPLOYING THIS RELEASE.

Add the following to brig:

```
brig:
  config:
    optSettings:
      setFederationStrategy: allowNone # [allowAll | allowDynamic | allowNone]
      setFederationDomainConfigsUpdateFreq: 10 # seconds
```

`allowNone` is equivalent to `allowList` with empty list; `allowAll`
remains the same as before; `allowDynamic` is `allowList`, but the
list is now stored in cassandra, not the config file.

If your federator config values contain something like this:

```
    federationStrategy:
      allowedDomains:
      - red.example.com
      - blue.example.com
```

you need to make sure that the following lines are part of your brig
config (after the upgrade and until you have loaded the data into
casssandra, federation with those domains won't possible if you forget
this):

```
brig:
  config:
    optSettings:
      setFederationDomainConfigs:
      - domain: red.example.com
        search_policy: full_search
      - domain: blue.example.com
        search_policy: no_search
```

The search policy for a remote backend can be:
- `no_search`: No users are returned by federated searches. default.
- `exact_handle_search`: Only users where the handle exactly matches are returned.
- `full_search`: Additionally to exact_handle_search, users are found by a freetext search on handle and display name.

Once the upgrade has been deployed *and* table
`brig.federation_remotes` has been filled with the temporary contents
of `brig.config.optSettings.setFederationDomainConfigs`, it is safe to
remove the latter and the above lines from the federator config.
