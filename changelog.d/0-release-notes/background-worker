Introduce background-worker (#3276, #3314, #3333, #3366)

This release introduces a new component: background-worker. This is currently
only used to forward notifications to federated backends. Enabling federation in
the wire-server helm chart automatically installs this component.

When federation is enabled, wire-server will require running RabbitMQ. The helm
chart in `rabbitmq` can be used to install RabbitMQ. Please refer to the
documentation at https://docs.wire.com to install RabbitMQ in Kubernetes. These
new configurations are required:

```yaml
brig:
  config:
    rabbitmq:
      host: rabbitmq
      port: 5672
      vHost: /
  secrets:
    rabbitmq:
      username: <YOUR_USERNAME>
      password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
galley:
  config:
    rabbitmq:
      host: rabbitmq
      port: 5672
      vHost: /
  secrets:
    rabbitmq:
      username: <YOUR_USERNAME>
      password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
background-worker:
  config:
    rabbitmq:
      host: rabbitmq
      port: 5672
      vHost: /
      adminPort: 15672
  secrets:
    rabbitmq:
      username: <YOUR_USERNAME>
      password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
```

The above are the default values (except for secrets, which do not have
defaults), if they work they are not required to be configured.
