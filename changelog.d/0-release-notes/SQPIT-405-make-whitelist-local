In (the unlikely) case your server config file contains `setWhitelist:`, you need to change this before the upgrade!  It used to refer to a whitelisting service, which is now replaced with a local list of allowed domains and phone numbers.  See [docs](https://docs.wire.com/developer/reference/user/activation.html?highlight=whitelist#phone-email-whitelist) for details.  Migration path: add new config fields; upgrade, remove old config fields.
