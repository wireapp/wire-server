The wire-server now uses quorum queues for user notifications, communicating
with cells and for watching dead lettered user-notifications. These were
previously declared without any type making them "classic" RabbitMQ queues.

The transition is unfortunately not automatic. There are no official clients of
wire-server which use these queues, so in most cases there should only be two
queues which need to moved over:
1. cells_events
2. dead-user-notifications

If there are no other classic queues and no cells server is deployed, the steps
of upgrade are very simple:

1. Delete these queues
2. Deploy the new version of wire-server

Please note that rolling back this deployment would not be possible unless these
queues are deleted again.

In case there are other classic queues of format
`user-notifications.<user-id>.<client-id>` or if a cells server is configured,
then this ugprade would require some downtime. The steps are documented on
