For users of the (currently alpha) coturn Helm chart, **manual action is
required** when upgrading to this version. The labels applied to the Kubernetes
manifests in this chart have changed, in order to match the conventions used
in the wire-server charts. However, this may mean that upgrading with Helm can
fail, due to changes to the `StatefulSet` included in this chart -- in this
case, the `StatefulSet` must be deleted before the chart is upgraded.
