This release introduces a **breaking change** in the `databases-ephemeral` and `redis-ephemeral` Helm charts.

The upstream Helm chart used for `redis-ephemeral` has been replaced to enable an upgrade to **Redis 7.4.6** (previously based on the Bitnami chart). As a result, the Redis service hostname has changed from
`{{ .Release.Name }}-master` → `{{ .Release.Name }}`.

Please update the `gundeck.config.redis.host` value in the `wire-server` configuration accordingly.

The updated Helm chart only supports standalone deployments.

If you are providing custom values to the `databases-ephemeral` or `redis-ephemeral` releases, make sure to review the documentation for `redis-ephemeral` and its upstream Helm chart to ensure compatibility with this update.
