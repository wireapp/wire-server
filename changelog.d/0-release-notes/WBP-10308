Notifications are now sent via RabbitMQ. Therefore RabbitMQ is now a required dependency for Cannon and Gundeck.
Cassandra is now a required dependency for Cannon and Background-Worker.
Both of them need access to the Gundeck keyspace.
Brig also needs RabbitMQ configured, before this was contingent on Federation being enabled.
These are breaking changes for Charts.
