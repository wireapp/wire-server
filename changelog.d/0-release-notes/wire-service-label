In the helm charts, the `wireService` label has been removed.

In some cases, we were already setting the `app` label too.

Now we consistently use the `app` label to label different wire services.

The `wireService` label was also used in the `spec.selector.matchLabels` field
on existing `Deployment` / `StatefulSet` resources.
As these fields being immutable, changing them isn't possible without recreation.

If you encounter an issue like

> field is immutable && cannot patch "*" with kind *

you need to manually delete these StatefulSet and Deployment resources, and apply helm again, which will recreate them.

This means downtime, so plan a maintenance window for it.

The `wire-server-metrics` chart was previously running some custom
configuration to automatically add all payloads with a `wireService` label into
metrics scraping.

With the removal of the `wireService` label, this custom configuration has been
removed.

Instead, all services that expose metrics will now create `ServiceMonitor`
resources, if their helm chart is applied with `metrics.serviceMonitor.enable`
set to true.

This prevents scraping agents from querying services that don't expose metrics
at /i/metrics unnecessarily.

Additionally, makes it easier to run other metric scraping operators, like
`grafana-agent-operator`, without the need to also create some custom
`wireService` label config there.

Generally, if you have any monitoring solution installed in your cluster that
uses the Prometheus CRDs, set `metrics.serviceMonitor.enable` for the following charts:

 - brig
 - cannon
 - cargohold
 - galley
 - gundeck
 - proxy
 - spar
