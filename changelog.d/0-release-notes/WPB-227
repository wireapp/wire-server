There is a new optional Boolean option, `multiSFT.enabled`, in `brig.yaml`,
allowing calls between federated SFT servers. If provided, the field
`is_federating` in the response of `/calls/config/authenticated` will reflect
`multiSFT.enabled`'s value.

Example:

```
# [brig.yaml]
multiSFT:
  enabled: true
```

Also, the optional object `sftToken` with its fields `ttl`, `secret`, and
`secondsBeforeNew` define whether an SFT credential would be rendered in the
response of `/calls/config/authenticated`. The field `ttl` determines the
seconds for the credential to be valid, `secondsBeforeNew` determines the amount
of time which has to pass before a new token will be generated, preventing one
client to create too many new credentials, and `secret` is the path to the
secret shared with SFT to create credentials.

Example:

```
# [brig.yaml]
sft:
  sftBaseDomain: sft.wire.example.com
  sftSRVServiceName: sft
  sftDiscoveryIntervalSeconds: 10
  sftListLength: 20
  sftToken:
    ttl: 120
    secret: /path/to/secret
    secondsBeforeNew: 60
```
