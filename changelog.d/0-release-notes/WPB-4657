The development API is now disabled by default.
The old structure of the server config is compatible with this change. So it is safe to deploy this without changing the server config.
However, if you want to disable the development API explicitly by adding the `development` keyword to the list of disabled APIs, this has to be done during or after the deployment of the services, not before.
