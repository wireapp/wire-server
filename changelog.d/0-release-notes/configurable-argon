Password hashing can now be done using argon2id instead of scrypt. The argon2id parameters can be configured using these options:

```yaml
brig:
  optSettings:
    setPasswordHashingOptions:
      algorithm: argon2id
      iterations: ...
      memory: ... # memory needed in KiB
      parallelism: ...
galley:
  settings:
    passwordHashingOptions:
      algorithm: argon2id
      iterations: ...
      memory: ... # memory needed in KiB
      parallelism: ...
```

The deployments still default to using scrypt as moving to argon2id might require allocating more resources according to configured parameters.

**NOTE** It is highly recommended to move to argon2id and it will be made the
  only available choice for the `algorithm` config option in future.
