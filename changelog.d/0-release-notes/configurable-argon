Password hashing can now be done using argon2id instead of scrypt. The argon2id parameters can be configured using these options:

```yaml
brig:
  optSettings:
    setPasswordHashingOptions:
      algorithm: argon2id
      iterations: ...
      memory: ... # memory needed in KiB
      parallelism: ...
galley:
  settings:
    passwordHashingOptions:
      algorithm: argon2id
      iterations: ...
      memory: ... # memory needed in KiB
      parallelism: ...
```

The default option is still to use scrypt as moving to argon2id might require
allocating more resources according to configured parameters.

When configured to use argon2id, the DB will be migrated slowly over time as the
users enter their passwords (either to login or to do other operations which
require explicit password entry). This migration is **NOT** done in reverse,
i.e., if a deployment started with argon2id as the algorithm then chose to move
to scrypt, the passwords will not get rehashed automatically, instead the users
will have to reset their passwords if that is desired.

**NOTE** It is highly recommended to move to argon2id as it will be made the
  only available choice for the `algorithm` config option in future.
