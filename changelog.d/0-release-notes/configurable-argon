Password hashing is now done using argon2id instead of scrypt. The argon2id parameters can be configured using these options:

```yaml
brig:
  optSettings:
    setPasswordHashingOptions:
      iterations: ...
      memory: ... # memory needed in KiB
      parallelism: ...
galley:
  settings:
    passwordHashingOptions:
      iterations: ...
      memory: ... # memory needed in KiB
      parallelism: ...
```

These have default values, which should work for most deployments. Please see documentation on config-options for more.
