* Replace fake-sqs with ElasticMQ

ElasticMQ is an actively maintained project, fake-sqs hasn't seen a commit since
2018. This is not expected to have any noticeable effect on deployments that
don't have any extra configurations for the SQS queues. If the fake-aws-sqs
chart had configured custom queue names, they have couple of extra limitations:
- The queue names must only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
- The FIFO queue names must end in `.fifo`.
