New 'ingress-nginx-controller' wrapper chart compatible with kubernetes versions [1.23 - 1.26]. The old one 'nginx-ingress-controller' (compatible only up to k8s 1.19) is now DEPRECATED.
We advise to upgrade your version of kubernetes in use to 1.23 or higher (we tested on kubernetes version 1.26), and to make use of the new ingress controller chart. Main features:
- up-to-date nginx version ('1.21.6')
- TLS 1.3 support (including allowing specifying which cipher suites to use)
- security fixes
- no more accidental logging of Wire access tokens under specific circumstances

The 'kind: Ingress' resources installed via 'nginx-ingress-services' chart remain compatible with both the old and the new ingress controller, and k8s versions [1.18 - 1.26]. In case you upgrade an existing kubernetes cluster (not recommended), you may need to first uninstall the old controller before installing the new controller chart.

In case you have custom overrides, you need to modify the directory name and top-level configuration key:

```diff
# If you have overrides for the controller chart (such as cipher suites), ensure to rename file and top-level key:
-# nginx-ingress-controller/values.yaml
+# ingress-nginx-controller/values.yaml
-nginx-ingress:
+ingress-nginx:
   controller:
     # ...
```

and double-check if all overrides you use are indeed provided under the same name by the upstream chart. See also the default overrides in [the default values.yaml](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/develop/charts/ingress-nginx-controller/values.yaml).

In case you use helmfile change your ingress controller like this:

```diff
# helmfile.yaml
releases:
-  - name: 'nginx-ingress-controller'
+  - name: 'ingress-nginx-controller'
     namespace: 'wire'
-    chart: 'wire/nginx-ingress-controller'
+    chart: 'wire/ingress-nginx-controller'
     version: 'CHANGE_ME'
```
