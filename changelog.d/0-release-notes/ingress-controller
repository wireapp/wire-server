New nginx-ingress-controller wrapper chart compatible with k8s versions [1.21 - 1.26].
In case you have custom overrides, you need to modify the top-level configuration key:

```diff
# IF you have overrides in
# nginx-ingress-controller/values.yaml
-nginx-ingress:
+ingress-nginx:
   controller:
```

and double-check if all overrides you use are indeed provided under the same name by the upstream chart.
