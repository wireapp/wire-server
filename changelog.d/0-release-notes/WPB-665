If you are mapping an email address to the `externalId` field in the
scim schema, please check the following list for items that apply to
you and recommended steps before/during/after upgrade.

- **Situation:** the `emails` field of in your scim user records is
    empty.

  **What you need to do:** change your schema mapping to contain the
    same address in `externalId` and (as a record with one element) in
    `emails`.

- **Situation:** the `emails` field of your scim user records is
    non-empty.

  **What you need to do:** make sure `emails` contains exactly one
    entry, which is the email from `externalId`.  If there is a
    discrepancy, the address from `emails` will become the new
    (unvalidated) address of the user, and the user will receive an
    email to validate it.  If the email cannot be sent or is ignored
    by the recipient, the *valid* address will not be changed.
