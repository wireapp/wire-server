Please check the following list for items that apply to you and recommended steps before/during/after upgrade.

- Situation: You are using SCIM with an email address as
externalId.

What you need to do: change your schema mapping to contain the
same email address in the list under field emails (priority is
irrelevant as long as you only set this one address).

(empty emails will also work, nothing changes)

- Situation: the emails field of your scim user records is
non-empty.

What you need to do: if the first priority email in the list
(or, if that doesn't exist, the first email) matches externalId,
nothing needs to be done.  If there is a discrepancy, the address
from emails will become the new (unvalidated) email address of the
user, and the user will receive an email to validate it.  If the
user cannot be reached under the address from emails cannot be
reached, the valid email will not be changed.

- Situation: the emails field of in your scim user records is
empty. => no problem

What you need to do: the emails field will be filled from here
on out, and ....  TODO(hm, or is the emails field emptied on first update? (probably not or are updates bidirectional?))
