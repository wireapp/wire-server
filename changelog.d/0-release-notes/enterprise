This release contains a new Git submodule: `wire-server-enterprise`. This module
represents a service which contains all non-open-source features. Wire can still
be deployed and run without this service. Building it without
`wire-server-enterprise` is currently not documented, but Wire will keep providing the artefacts.

The service can be deployed with a dedicated Helm chart
(`charts/wire-server-enterprise`.) The required service image is not freely
available (the registry is password protected.)
