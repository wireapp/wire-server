The deprecated endpoint `GET /teams` has changed slightly in a non-breaking way.
The endpoint was designed to query non-binding teams. However, non-binding teams is a feature 
that has never been implemented, but the endpoint also returns the binding team of a user and it is 
possible that this is being used by a client, even though unlikely.

The following functionality has been changed. Query parameters will be ignored, which has the effect 
that regardless of the parameters the response will always contain the binding team of the user if 
it exists. Even though they are ignored, the use of query parameters will not result in an error.
