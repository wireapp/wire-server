Switch from ElasticSearch 6.8 to OpenSearch 1.3 (we're testing with OpenSearch
1.3.19.) Please note that the APIs of ElasticSearch 6.8 and OpenSearch 1.3 are
not compatible. I.e., either a migration is required
(https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/upgrade-to/) or the indexes need to be
rebuilt from scratch. The latter is done automatically when the
`elasticsearch-index-create` job of the `elasticsearch-index` Helm chart faces
an OpenSearch instance where Wire's indexes are missing. Alternatively, this can
be started manually; see
https://docs.wire.com/developer/reference/elastic-search.html#refill-es-documents-from-cassandra
. Depending on the amount of users in the database, this may take long.
