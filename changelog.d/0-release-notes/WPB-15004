We changed the default MLS cipher suite from

- MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519

to

- MLS_128_DHKEMP256_AES128GCM_SHA256_P256

and the allowed MLS cipher suites from only

- MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519

to _only_

- MLS_128_DHKEMP256_AES128GCM_SHA256_P256.

ATTENTION: This breaks your MLS clients if they used the previous defaults
before. This is even true if you allow several cipher suites, since current MLS
clients only support _one_ cipher suite at a time.

[Adjust the defaults in the server
configuration](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/develop/docs/src/developer/reference/config-options.md#mls)
to switch the values of `defaultCipherSuite` and `allowedCipherSuites` back to
the previous defaults, `1` and `[1]`, respectively. Once MLS clients support
several cipher suites, you could even use `[1,2]` or a list of other cipher
suites in `allowedCipherSuites`. Make sure that this list contains the currently
used cipher suite!
