Generated Swagger docs differed from the ratified ones for versions up to V9
regarding the `get-all-registered-domains`
(`/teams/{teamId}/registered-domains`) endpoint: The `backend_url` became part
of the `backend` object which should be introduced with V10. As teams do not
set backend redirects this should not be seen in practice.
