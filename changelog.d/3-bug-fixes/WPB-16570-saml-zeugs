Make saml2-web-sso library more robust against forged authentication responses.

- only process *signed* xml data from authentication requests (to the extent permitted by the standards)
- compare issuer in stored authentication request with issuer(s) from assertions.

neither of these changes fix any known vulnerabilities, but the changes make the code more defensive in case other weaknesses are still lurking.
