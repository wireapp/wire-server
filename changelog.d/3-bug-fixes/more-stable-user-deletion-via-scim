SCIM user deletion suffered from a couple of race conditions. The user in now first deleted in spar, because this process depends on data from brig. Then, the user is deleted in brig. If any error occurs, the SCIM deletion request can be made again. This change depends on brig being completely deployed before using the SCIM deletion endpoint in brig. In the unlikely event of using SCIM deletion during the deployment, these requests can be retried (in case of error).
