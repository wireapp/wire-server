Fix a rate-limit exemption whereby authenticated endpoints did not get the unlimited_requests_endpoint, if set, applied. This is a concern for the webapp and calls to /assets, which can happen in larger numbers on initial loading. A previous change in [this PR](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/pull/2786) had no effect. This PR also increases default rate limits, to compensate for [new ingress controller chart](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/pull/3140)'s default topologyAwareRouting. (#3138, #3201)
