Passively migrate user passwords from scrypt to argon2id.

By passively we mean that whenever a user re-enters their passwords, if it was hashed using scrypt, it is then rehashed using argon2id and stored as such. 
If that user has a legacy short password (under 8 characters in length), it does not migrate to argon2id.
