Most error effects in Galley are now defined at the granularity of single error values. For example, a handler throwing `ConvNotFound` will now directly declare `ConvNotFound` (as a promoted constructor) among its error effects, instead of the generic `ConversationError` that was used before. Correspondingly, all such fine-grained Galley errors have been moved to wire-api as constructors of a single enumerated type `GalleyError`, and similarly for Brig, Cannon and Cargohold.
