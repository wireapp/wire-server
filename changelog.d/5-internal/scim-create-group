Introducing user groups in SCIM involved a lot of refactorings:
- some of Brig.CanonicalInterpreters has been moved (copied?) to wire-subsystems (notably stomp, aws, events)
- Spar.CanonicalInterpreter has been extended to make use of the subsystems formerly only used by brig (somme of the interpreters are undefined because unused)
- since that running brig code in spar wasn't always feasible: brig internal api has been extended to expose UserGroupSubsystem to spar
