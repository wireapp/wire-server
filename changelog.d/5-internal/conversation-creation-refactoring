Refactor conversation record and conversation creation functions. This removes a lot of duplication and makes the types of protocol-specific data in a conversation tighter.

 - Move conversation name size check to `NewConv`
 - Make the `NewConversation` record (used as input to the data
   function creating a conversation) contain a `ConversationMetadata`.
 - Implement all "special" conversation creation in terms of a general `createConversation`
 - Move protocol field from metadata to Conversation
 - Restructure MLS fields in Conversation record
 - Factor out metadata fields from Data.Conversation
