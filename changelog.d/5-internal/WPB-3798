JSON derived schemas have been changed to no longer pre-process record fields to drop prefixes that were required to disambiguate fields.
Prefix processing still exists to drop leading underscores from field names, as we are using prefixed field names with `makeLenses`.
Code has been updated to use `OverloadedRecordDot` with the changed field names.
