All integration tests can generate XML reports.

To generate the report in brig-integration, galley-integration,
cargohold-integration, gundeck-integration, stern-integration and the new
integration suite pass `--xml=<outfile>` to generate the XML file.

For spar-integration and federator-integration pass `-f junit` and set
`JUNIT_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` and `JUNIT_SUITE_NAME` environment variables. The XML
report will be generated at `$JUNIT_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/junit.xml`.
