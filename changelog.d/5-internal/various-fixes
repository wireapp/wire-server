Various improvements and fixes around SAML/SCIM
* the error message when attempting to saml-authenticate with a user that should have been provisioned by scim, but wasn't, was confusing.  we have a better one now, and the function has a clearer structure.
* is bumping saml2-web-sso to the latest master, and *shouldn't* change any behavior: saml2-web-sso is providing `CI.CI`-wrapped values in a few places (mostly email and NameID), and we just unpack it using `CI.original`, which recovers all casing information.  in the future, we'll have the option to treat emails case-insensitively as we're supposed to.  (there is currently another, more hacky way in which we do this, see [here](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/de673a6fbb2e1a9dc9cdb928cd9b7c4a291470dd/services/spar/src/Spar/Data.hs#L281-L296) and [the internal issue](https://wearezeta.atlassian.net/browse/SQSERVICES-776).)
