The on-conversation-updated notification is now queued instead of being sent directly. A new version of the notification has been introduced with a different JSON format for the body, mostly for testing purposes of the versioning system.

Since the notification is now sent asynchronously, some error conditions in case of unreachable backends cannot be triggered anymore.
