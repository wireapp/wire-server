The coturn chart now supports multiple authentication secrets, which permits
multiple backend instances to use the same TURN servers without needing to
share authentication secrets between the backend instances.

Correspondingly, the `.Values.secrets.zrestSecret` configuration option, which
took a single authentication secret as its argument, has been replaced with the
option `.Values.secrets.zrestSecrets` (note spelling!), which instead takes a
*list* of authentication secrets as its argument.
