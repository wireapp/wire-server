Optionally add invitation urls to the body of `/teams/{tid}/invitations`. This allows further processing; e.g. to send those links with custom emails or distribute them as QR codes. As this feature can cause privacy issues (the administrator could do the registrations on their own), it's enabled in two steps: First, the team ID has to be added to the list `settings.featureFlags.exposeInvitationURLsTeamAllowlist` in galley's server configuration. Then, the team feature flag `exposeInvitationURLsToTeamAdmin` can be enabled.
