Support connecting to Elasticsearch over TLS

It can be enabled by setting these options on the wire-server helm chart:

```yaml
brig:
  config:
    elasticsearch:
      scheme: https

      # When custom CAs are required, one of these must be set:
      tlsCa: <PEM encoded CA certificates>
      tlsCaSecretRef:
        name: <Name of the secret>
        key: <Key in the secret containing pem encoded CA Cert>

      # When TLS needs to be used without verification:
      insecureSkipVerifyTls: true

elasticsearch-index:
  elasticsearch:
    scheme: https

    # When custom CAs are required, one of these must be set:
    tlsCa: <PEM encoded CA certificates>
    tlsCaSecretRef:
      name: <Name of the secret>
      key: <Key in the secret containing pem encoded CA Cert>

    # When TLS needs to be used without verification:
    insecureSkipVerifyTls: true
```
