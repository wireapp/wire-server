Support connecting to Redis over TLS

It can be enabled by setting these options on the wire-server helm chart:

```yaml
gundeck:
  config:
    redis:
      enableTLS: true

      # When custom CAs are required, one of these must be set:
      tlsCa: <PEM encoded CA certificates>
      tlsCaSecretRef:
        name: <Name of the secret>
        key: <Key in the secret containing pem encoded CA Cert>

      # When TLS needs to be used without verification:
      insecureSkipTlsVerify: true
```
