The coturn chart has new functionality to enable graceful pod termination, by
waiting for all active allocations on a coturn instance to drain first. When
combined with a suitable external service discovery mechanism which can steer
client traffic away from terminating coturn pods, this can be used to implement
graceful rolling restarts of clusters of coturn instances.
