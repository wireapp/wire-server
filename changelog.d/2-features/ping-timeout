The /events websocket will close a connection when it detects client inactivity. The inactivity behaviour can be controlled by setting the cannon options `wsOpts.activityTimeout` and `wsOpts.pongTimeout`. After `wsOpts.activityTimeout` microseconds of client inactivity (including no pings), the server sends a ping, and waits for a corresponding pong for `wsOpts.pongTimeout` microseconds. If no pong is received within this time window, the connection is terminated.
