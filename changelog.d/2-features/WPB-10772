Makes it impossible for a user to join an MLS conversation while already under legalhold (at least pending)

This implies two things: 
1. If a user is under legalhold they cannot ever join an MLS conversation, not even an MLS self conversation.
2. A user has to reject to be put under legalhold when they want to join an MLS conversation (ignoring the request to be put under legalhold is not enough).
