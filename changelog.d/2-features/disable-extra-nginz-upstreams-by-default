The list of upstreams is split into `nginx_conf.upstreams` and
`nginx_conf.extra_upstreams`. Extra upstreams are disabled by default. They can
be enabled by adding their name (entry's key) to
`nginx_conf.enabled_extra_upstreams`. `nginx_conf.ignored_upstreams` is only
applied to upstreams from `nginx_conf.upstreams`. In the default configuration
of `nginz` extra upstreams are `ibis`, `galeb`, `calling-test` and `proxy`. If one
of those is deployed, it's name has be be added to
`nginx_conf.enabled_extra_upstreams` (otherwise, it won't be reachable). Unless
`nginx_conf.upstreams` hasn't been changed manually (overriding it's default),
this should be the only needed migration step.
