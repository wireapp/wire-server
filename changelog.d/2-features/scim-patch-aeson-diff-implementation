Implement some missing parts of `PATCH /scim/v2/User/{:id}`.

It also replaces our own ad-hoc implementation by one using aeson-diff
as a backbone. Still missing: Multi-valued attributes and array
operations; value-path filters (e.g., "emails[type eq 'work']");
Immutability checks for 'id' and 'meta' fields.
