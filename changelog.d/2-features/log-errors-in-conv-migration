Introduce new metrics for better tracking of conversation migration to postgresql:
1. `wire_local_convs_migration_failed`
2. `wire_user_remote_convs_migration_failed`

If any of these become `1`, it means the migration has failed. The logs would
contain the error. In order to restart the migration, the background-worker must
be restarted.
