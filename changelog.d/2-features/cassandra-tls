Allow the configuration of TLS-secured connections to Cassandra. TLS is used
when a certificate is provided. This is either done with
`--tls-ca-certificate-file` for cli commands or the configuration attribute
`cassandra.tlsCa` for services. In Helm charts, the certificate is provided as
literal PEM string; either as attribute `cassandra.tlsCa` (analog to service
configuration) or by a reference to a secret (`cassandra.tlsCaSecretRef`.)
