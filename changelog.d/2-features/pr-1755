Support using a single IDP with a single EntityID to set up two teams.
Sets up a migration, and makes teamID + EntityID unique, rather than relying on EntityID to be unique.
Required to support multiple teams in environments where the IDP software cannot present anything but one EntityID (E.G.: DualShield).
