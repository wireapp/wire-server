MLS implementation progress:
 - commit messages containing add proposals are now processed (#2247)
 - do initial validation and forwarding of all types of messages via POST /mls/messages (#2253)
 - fixed bug where users could not be added to MLS conversations if they had non-MLS clients (#2290)
 - MLS/Proteus mismatches (e.g. sending a proteus message to an MLS conversation) are now handled (#2278)
 - the `POST /mls/key-packages/claim` endpoint gained a `skip_own` query parameter, which can be used to avoid claiming a key package for the requesting client itself (#2287)
