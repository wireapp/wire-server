Added configuration options for argon2id password hashing. Defaults:

```yaml
    setPasswordHashingOptions:
      iterations: 1
      memory: 180224 # memory needed in kibibytes (1 kibibyte is 2^10 bytes)
      parallelism: 32
```

You can change this in your server config:

```yaml
brig:
  optSettings:
    setPasswordHashingOptions:
      iterations: ...
      memory: ... # memory needed in kibibytes (1 kibibyte is 2^10 bytes)
      parallelism: ...
```

**Performance implications:** scrypt takes ~80ms on a realistic test
system, and argon2id with default settings takes ~500ms. This is a
runtime increase by a factor of ~6.  This happens every time a
password is entered by the user: during login, password reset,
deleting a device, etc. (It does **NOT** happen during any are
cryptographic operations like session key update or message
de-/encryption.)

The settings are a trade-off between resilience against brute force
attacks and password secrecy.  For most systems this should be safe
and not need more hardware resources for brig, but you may want to
form your own opinion.
