-- | Returns a list of notifications for given 'uid'
--
--
-- Takes an optional parameter 'since' which is a V1 UUID, (which includes a
-- timestamp).
--
-- If the parameter 'since' is omitted, all notifications of the user are
-- returned. This is not recommended. (TODO: Ask client teams if they ever use
-- this)
--
-- If the parameter 'since' fails to parse, all notifications of the user are
-- returned but the status code is set to 404.
-- FUTUREWORK: We should change this behaviour as it's extremely confusing. We
-- could kindly reject with a 400, and not event hit the database at all.
-- This was introduced in
-- https://github.com/zinfra/orlop/pull/30/commits/a358dfc1cb225c92066ea79db28c8824531ae231
--
-- If the 'since' parameter is present, and a notification 'since' is actually
-- found in the database, this returns all the notifications since 'since'
-- (exclusive of 'since' itself) and returns a status code 200.
--
-- If the 'since' parameter is present, and a notification 'since' is not found
-- in the database, then due to the fact that 'since' is a V1 UUID (which
-- contains a timestamp) we can still return all the notifications that
-- happened after it eventhough it is not present in the database. This can
-- happen for example because a client hasn't been online for 30 days and we
-- have deleted the notification in the backend in the meantime.
-- We will return all the notifications that we have that happened after 'since'
-- but return status code 404 to signal that 'since' itself was missing.
--
-- (arianvp): I am not sure why it is convenient for clients to distinguish
-- between these two cases.
