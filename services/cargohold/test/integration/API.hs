-- Federation behaviour

-- This test doesn't fit in well with the `integration` style of tests. This is
-- because setting up the asset to have the weird state where the asset key exists,
-- but somehow the asset itself can't be downloaded is a bit beyond what the API
-- integration setup allows. So this specific test can stay here for now.
