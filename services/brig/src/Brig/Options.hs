    -- This feature is a work-around for issues with our somewhat convoluted onboarding
    -- process.  We are working on a more sustainable solution.  Meanwhile this should not be
    -- used unless absolutely necessary (legal reasons, constracts).  It has numerous
    -- drawbacks:
    --
    -- * Changing it requires changing the configuration of the backend, which usually means
    --   a new release.  This is intentional to keep this feature from contaminating more of
    --   the code base (see below), but it also makes it awkward to use.
    --
    -- * So far, we have been using emails as opaque identifiers and not made any assumptions
    --   about their structure.  Now, email is still securely associated with a user, but can
    --   also be securely associated with another user who owns the first user's domain.  This
    --   new setup is more complex, and complexity is bad for security.  Security is now based
    --   on a much larger number of assumptions, and any one of these assumptions can be
    --   broken by software or usage errors.  Example: is it even legal for the owner of an
    --   email domain to keep users from signing up with wire using that email?  This is
    --   possibly true for domains like @mystartup.com@, but what about
    --   @globalmailhosting.com@?  Other example: next point.
    --
    -- * We could implement something more sophisticated involving 'TXT' DNS records that the
    --   team admin needs to set up containing some secrets obtainable via team settings.
    --   This is a lot more involved to implement, and very easy for coders or users to get
    --   wrong.
