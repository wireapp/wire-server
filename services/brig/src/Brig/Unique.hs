-- [Note: Guarantees]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- Correct operation (i.e. uniqueness of claims) rests on the following
-- properties of the implementation, which must have a negligible probability
-- of failure:
--
-- 1. CRDT properties of CQL Sets with the only operation of element addition,
--    in particular that all element additions are preserved in a concurrent
--    setting (cf. https://aphyr.com/posts/294-jepsen-cassandra).
--
-- 2. Strong read consistency (QUORUM write followed by QUORUM read)
--    combined with the conflict-free property of Set element insertions (1)
--    ensures that, of any two concurrent claims, at least one of them is
--    bound to see both inserted elements, hence failing the claim.
--
-- 3. The 'IO' computation that is run while holding a claim must complete
--    within the given timeout. The effective timeout (i.e. the row TTL)
--    is doubled, for an extra safety margin.
