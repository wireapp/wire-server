-- | @withBudget (BudgetKey "k") (Budget 30 5) action@ runs @action@ at most 5 times every 30
-- seconds.  @"k"@ is used for keeping different calls to 'withBudget' apart; use something
-- there that's unique to your context, like @"login#" <> uid@.
--
-- See the docs in "Gundeck.ThreadBudget" for related work.
--
-- FUTUREWORK: encourage caller to define their own type for budget keys (rather than using an
-- untyped text), and represent the types in a way that guarantees that if i'm using a local
-- type that i don't export, then nobody will be able to use my namespace.
--
-- FUTUREWORK: exceptions are not handled very nicely, but it's not clear what it would mean
-- to improve this.
