-- user_keys_hash usage was removed in https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/pull/2902
--
-- However, it's dangerous to remove a cassandra table together with the usage, as
-- during deployment, there is a time window where the schema migration has run, but the
-- old code still serves traffic, which then leads to 5xxs and user-observable errors.
-- Therefore the policy is to wait a reasonable amount of time (6 months) to allow all
-- installations to upgrade before removing the database tables. See also
-- backwards-incompatbile schema migration docs in
-- https://docs.wire.com/developer/developer/cassandra-interaction.html?highlight=backwards+incompatbile#backwards-incompatible-schema-changes
--
-- FUTUREWORK: remove futurework_number and replace its usage by the next matching number after July 2023, rename this module with a version number, and
-- integrate it inside Main.hs and App.hs
