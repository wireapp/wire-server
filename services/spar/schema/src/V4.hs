  -- Notes:
  --
  -- 1. We can have several tokens per team (if the team uses several
  --    provisioning tools), and it should be possible to revoke one
  --    without revoking the other. However, for each token there can only
  --    be one team.
  --
  -- 2. Each token can have an IdP associated with it; this will be the
  --    IdP used to authenticate the user.
