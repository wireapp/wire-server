-- RATIONALE: Finding the handle can fail for users that have been created without scim, and
-- have stopped the onboarding process at the point where they are asked by the client to
-- enter a handle.
--
-- We make up a handle in this case, and the scim peer can find the user, see that the handle
-- is not the one it expects, and update it.
--
-- We cannot simply respond with 404 in this case, because the user exists.  404 would suggest
-- do the scim peer that it should post the user to create it, but that would create a new
-- user instead of finding the old that should be put under scim control.
