-- | A type family that prepares our API for docs generation.
--
-- Our Swagger docs are intended to be used by client developers, and not
-- all endpoints are useful for them or should be seen by them. Here we
-- assume the 'spar' service is only accessible from behind the 'nginz'
-- proxy, which handles authorization (adding a Z-User header if requests
-- are authorized)
--
-- We also omit all branches marked with 'OmitDocs'. Those are likely to be:
--
--   * Endpoints for which we can't generate Swagger docs.
--   * The endpoint that serves Swagger docs.
--   * Internal endpoints.
