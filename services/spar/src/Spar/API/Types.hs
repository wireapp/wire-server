-- | Dual-use route for initiating either login or bind.
--
-- We could distinguish the two cases by the presence or absence of a `Z-User` header.  However, we
-- also need to use this route under two different prefices because nginz only supports mandatory
-- auth and no auth, but not optional auth for any given end-point.  See also: 'DoInitiate'.
--
-- __Binding existing users to SSO__
--
-- A user has an existing account with email address and password, and gets idp credentails.  She
-- now wants to upgrade her password-based login to sso login, or *bind* the existing user to the
-- sso credentials.
--
-- __The Solution__
--
--   0. user logs in with password
--   1. inside the session, she requests `/sso-initiate-bind/<idp>` for an idp of her choice (idp
--      must be registered with her team)
--   2. spar checks the `Z-User` header and sends a short-lived bind cookie with the response that
--      otherwise is the same as for `/sso/initiate-login/<idp>`
--   3. everybody goes through the well-known SAML web sso moves, until:
--   4. the authentication response is sent to `/sso/finalize-login/<idp>` together with the bind
--      cookie
--   5. spar identifies the user both via the bind cookie and via the SAML authentication response,
--      and performs the binding.
--
-- Why a special cookie, and not the cookie already available, or the session token?  The wire cookie
-- gets only sent to `/access`, and we would need to change that; session tokens are hard to handle
-- while switching between app context and browser context.  Having a separate cookie makes both the
-- context switching simple and allows us to set a different cookie recipient end-point and short
-- cookie lifetime.
--
-- This solution is very flexible.  UX variants:
--
--   * team admin posts the initiate-bind link in a group in the wire team.  no new UI components
--     are needed in the frontend.
--   * we add buttons in the settings page somewhere.
--   * we send a link containing a token to the user by email.  when the user clicks on the link,
--     she gets authenticated and redirected to the initiate-bind end-point in step 1 above.
--   * ...?
--
-- __Corner Case: Accidental Creation of new SSO User__
--
-- What happens if the user authenticates via SSO first, creates a new user, and then receives the
-- bind invite?
--
-- Possible solutions:
--
--   * The IdP could create all users via SCIM and we block implicit user creation.
--   * After the fact, the duplicated user deletes the SSO user, loses a little bit of user data,
--     and goes through the bind process.
--   * Block implicit creation for a short time window, and ask all existing users to use that time
--     window to bind.
