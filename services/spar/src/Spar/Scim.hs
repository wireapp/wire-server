-- | An implementation of the SCIM API for doing bulk operations with users.
--
-- See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_for_Cross-domain_Identity_Management>
--
-- = SCIM user creation flow
--
-- When a user is created via SCIM, a SAML user identity has to be created with it. Currently
-- we don't allow SCIM users without SAML user identities.
--
-- Creating these two user identities (SCIM and SAML) together requires constructing a
-- 'UserRef' from the SCIM request, which is then stored by 'Spar.Data.insertUser'.
--
-- The 'UserRef' consists of:
--
--   * tenant (the url-shaped ID the IdP assigns to itself);
--
--   * subject (usually an email, or an unstructured nickname, or a few more obscure
--     alternatives).
--
-- /Tenant:/ if there is only one IdP for the current team, the tenant can be found by calling
-- 'getIdPConfigsByTeam' and looking up @^. idpMetadata . edIssuer@ on the result. If there is
-- more than one IdP, we need a way to associate user creation requests with specific IdPs.
-- Currently we disallow teams with more than one IdP.
--
-- /Subject:/ there are different reasonable ways to pick a subject for a user; this should be
-- configurable in the team settings page (e.g. a choice of one field from the SCIM user
-- schema, optionally transformed with one of a few hard-coded functions). A simple default
-- could be "take the email address, and type it as an email address", or in saml2-web-sso
-- pseudo-code: @\email -> entityNameID (parseURI ("email:" <> renderEmail email))@.
