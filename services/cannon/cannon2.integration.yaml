# Example yaml-formatted configuration for cannon used in integration tests

# cannon can be started with a config file (e.g. ./dist/cannon -c cannon.yaml.example)

cannon:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8183

  # Each cannon instance advertises its own location (ip or dns name) to gundeck.
  # Either externalHost or externalHostFile must be set (externalHost takes precedence if both are defined)
  # externalHostFile expects a file with a single line containing the IP or dns name of this instance of cannon
  externalHost: 127.0.0.1
  #externalHostFile: /etc/wire/cannon/cannon-host.txt

gundeck:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8086
