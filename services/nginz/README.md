# NGINX build with extra modules

## Compile natively

To build nginz natively, ensure to have the usual C compiler toolchains installed, along with the following dependencies:

* gpg (needed to verify nginx's signatures)
* openssl
* libossp-uuid
* [libzauth](../../libs/libzauth) 
    * depends on the rust compiler, libsodium, [makedeb](../../tools/makedeb)

If you're on alpine, see the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for the precise dependency names. If you're on another platform, their names might differ slightly.

Once you have all necessary dependencies, `make` in this directory should work.

### Common problems while compiling

```
gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found
```

This means that you haven't imported the public key that was used to sign nginx. Look for the keys at https://nginx.org/en/pgp_keys.html and make sure to import them after with:

`gpg --import <path_to_key>`

Alternatively, you can ask GPG to find the key by its ID (printed in the error message):

`gpg --recv-keys KEY_ID`

---

```
checking for OpenSSL library ... not found
[...]
./configure: error: SSL modules require the OpenSSL library.
You can either do not enable the modules, or install the OpenSSL library
into the system, or build the OpenSSL library statically from the source
with nginx by using --with-openssl=<path> option.
```

openssl is required to compile nginx and it may be installed in a "non-standard" path in your system. Once you are sure you have installed it, look for `EXTRA_CC_INC` and `EXTRA_CC_LIB` in the `Makefile` and point them to the correct location in your system.

For instance, if you are using OSX and used `brew` to install openssl, you most likely need to change the `Makefile` to:
```
EXTRA_CC_INC ?= -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
EXTRA_CC_LIB ?= -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
```

## Compile with docker

`make docker`

## How to run it

Have a look at our demo config in [services demo](../../deploy/services-demo/conf/nginz)
