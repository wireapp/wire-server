-- FUTUREWORK(federation): Versioning of the federation API. See
-- https://higherkindness.io/mu-haskell/registry/ for some mu-haskell support
-- for versioning schemas here.

-- FUTUREWORK(federation): How do we make sure that only legitimate endpoints can be
-- reached, some discussion here:
-- https://wearezeta.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CORE/pages/224166764/Limiting+access+to+federation+endpoints
-- Also, see comment in 'Federator.Service.interpretService'
--
-- FUTUREWORK(federation): implement server2server authentication!
-- (current validation only checks parsing and compares to allowList)
--
-- FUTUREWORK: consider using Polysemy.Error also in callLocal to reduce nesting and improve readability.
