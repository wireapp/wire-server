-- This migration replaces the remote identifiers deleted in migration 48 with separate tables.
-- This change occurs because we decided to stop using opaque Ids. Instead, we'll be explict with remote identifiers.
-- Since two backends may have a conversation or user with the same UUID
-- (whether by chance or maliciously so), this change guarantees we don't
-- accidentally override information about a conversation on one backend by
-- information about a conversation on another backend.
