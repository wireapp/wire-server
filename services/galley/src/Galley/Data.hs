-- We use this newtype to highlight the fact that the 'Page' wrapped in here
-- can not reliably used for paging.
--
-- The reason for this is that Cassandra returns 'hasMore' as true if the
-- page size requested is equal to result size. To work around this we
-- actually request for one additional element and drop the last value if
-- necessary. This means however that 'nextPage' does not work properly as
-- we would miss a value on every page size.

-- because it gives access to `nextPage`, we give accessors to the results
-- and a more typed `hasMore` (ResultSetComplete | ResultSetTruncated)
