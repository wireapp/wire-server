-- The endpoint was designed to query non-binding teams. However, non-binding teams is a feature
-- that has never been adopted by clients, but the endpoint also returns the binding team of a user and it is
-- possible that this is being used by a client, even though unlikely.
--
-- The following functionality has been changed: query parameters will be ignored, which has the effect
-- that regardless of the parameters the response will always contain the binding team of the user if
-- it exists. Even though they are ignored, the use of query parameters will not result in an error.
--
-- (If you want to be pedantic, the `size` parameter is still honored: its allowed range is
-- between 1 and 100, and that will always be an upper bound of the result set of size 0 or
-- one.)

-- This could be extended for more checks, for now we test only legalhold
--
-- Brig's `POST /register` endpoint throws the errors returned by this endpoint
-- verbatim.
--
-- FUTUREWORK: When this enpoint gets Servantified, it should have a more
-- precise list of errors, LegalHoldError is too wide, currently this can
-- actaully only error with TooManyTeamMembersOnTeamWithLegalhold. Once we have
-- a more precise list of errors and the endpoint is servantified, we can use
-- those to enrich 'Wire.API.User.RegisterError' and ensure that these errors
-- also show up in swagger. Currently, the error returned by this endpoint is
-- thrown in IO, we could then refactor that to be thrown in `ExceptT
-- RegisterError`.
