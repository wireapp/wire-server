-- | Make sure that enough people are removed from all conversations that contain user `uid`
-- that no policy conflict arises.
--
-- It is guaranteed that no group will ever end up without a group admin because of a policy
-- conflict: If at least one group admin has 'ConsentGiven', non-consenting users are removed.
-- Otherwise, we assume that the group is dominated by people not interested in giving
-- consent, and users carrying LH devices are removed instead.
--
-- The first argument to this function needs explaining: in order to guarantee that this
-- function terminates before we set the LH of user `uid` on pending, we need to call it
-- first.  This means that user `uid` has outdated LH status while this function is running,
-- which may cause wrong behavior.  In order to guarantee correct behavior, the first argument
-- contains the hypothetical new LH status of `uid`'s so it can be consulted instead of the
-- one from the database.
