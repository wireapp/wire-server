-- | This module is a work-around for the fact that we do not send notifications to all users
-- of large teams any more.  For greeting bots to hear from new users, the 'MemberJoin' event
-- is stored in a queue that every member of a team can pull, in a similar (but not identical)
-- way as gundeck's @/notifications@ end-point, galley has a @/teams/notifications@ end-point
-- where these events can be pulled.
--
-- This module is a clone of "Gundeck.Notification".
--
-- This could have been added to gundeck, but we didn't.  Some motivation: (1) It is a *team*
-- event queue; teams live in galley, and only galley triggers the team events to be stored in
-- the teams.  (2) The team event queue differs from the other queues in that it is not a
-- fallback for websockets / push notifications, but the only source of the events; so a big
-- part of gundeck isn't really needed.  (3) Fewer RPCs, less code.
--
-- FUTUREWORK: this is a work-around because it only solves *some* problems with team events.
-- We should really use a scalable message queue instead.
