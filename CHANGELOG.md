## New Features

  * SSO: team member deletion, team deletion do not require
    the user to have chosen a password.  (Needed for
    SAML-authenticated team co-admins.)  #497

  * SSO: `sso-initiate-bind` end-point for inviting ("binding")
    existing users to SAML auth.  #496

  * SSO: shell script for registering IdPs in wire-teams.
    (`/deploy/services-demo/register_idp.sh`)  #489

  * Allow setting a different endpoint for generating download links.
    #480

  * Allow setting specific ports for SMTP and use different image for
    SMTP.  #481

  * Route calls/config in the demo to brig.  #487

## Internal Changes

  * Metrics for spar (service for SSO).  #498

  * Upgrade to stackage lts-11.  #478

  * Upgrade cql-io library.  #495

  * Allow easily running tests against AWS.  #482


# 2018-10-04  #477

## Highlights

  * We now store the `otr_muted_status` field per conversation,
    suitable for supporting more notifications options than just "muted/not
    muted". The exact meaning of this field is client-dependent.  #469

  * Our schema migration tools (which you are probably using if
    you're doing self-hosting) are more resilient now. They have longer
    timeouts and they wait for schema consistency across peers before
    reporting success.  #467

## Other changes

  * Building from scratch on macOS is now a tiny bit easier.  #474

  * Various Spar fixes, breaking changes, refactorings, and what-not. Please
    refer to the commit log, in particular commits c173f42b and
    80d06c9a.

  * Spar now only accepts a [subset][TLS ciphersuite] of available TLS
    ciphers. See af8299d4.
