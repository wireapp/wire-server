# [2023-01-26] (Chart Release 4.31.0)

## Release notes


* wire-server helm charts using Ingress resources are now compatible with kubernetes versions 1.22, 1.23 and 1.24 (but remain compatible with older versions of kubernetes).

  If you upgrade to this version of helm charts and/or you upgrade your version of kubernetes while wire-server is deployed, you may find that `helm update` or `helmfile apply/sync` gives an error like this:

  > Error: UPGRADE FAILED: current release manifest contains removed kubernetes api(s) for this kubernetes version and it is therefore unable to build the kubernetes objects for performing the diff. error from kubernetes: unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "Ingress" in version "extensions/v1beta1"

  In which case you can use the [helm mapkubeapis plugin](https://github.com/helm/helm-mapkubeapis) to upgrade an existing release with the following command:

  ```sh
  # install plugin version 0.1.0 (more recent may not work)
  helm plugin install --version v0.1.0 https://github.com/helm/helm-mapkubeapis
  # adjust helm release name and namespace as required
  helm mapkubeapis --namespace wire nginx-ingress-services
  ```

  Alternatively, if a few minutes of downtime are not a problem; you can `helm delete` a release and re-install it again, which will work without the above plugin. (#3002)

* Upgrade team-settings version to 4.14.0-v0.31.9-0-bf82b46 (#2180)

* Upgrade webapp version to 2023-01-24-production.0-v0.31.9-0-17b742f (#2302)


## API changes


* The unqualified `GET /conversations/:id` endpoint has been removed from API v3, and is restored to the previous behaviour of returning a Conversation using the v2 schema. Similarly, its qualified counterpart `GET /conversations/:domain/:id` now returns a v2 Conversation when accessed through API v2. (#2992)


## Bug fixes and other updates


* Fix pagination in team user search (make search key unique) (#2968)

* Update `inbucket` (fake smtp server) chart dependency: The prior version relied on an image that has been removed from docker hub. Thus, our own `inbucket` chart could not be deployed anymore. (#2998)


## Documentation


* Add sphinx-copybutton plugin to make copying snippets of code from docs.wire.com easier. (#2900)

* Hook federated API call documentation into docs.wire.com (manually). (#2988)

* Tool for dumping fed call graphs (dot/graphviz and csv); see README for details (#2973)


## Internal changes


* Add Helm chart to configure clusters managed by k8ssandra-operator for test environments. (#2981)

* Fix kind setup for running end-to-end federation tests locally. (#3008)

* Fix Makefile target kind-restart-all. (#3015)

* Add combinators for creating mocked federator responses in integration tests (#3014)

* Add two integration tests arounds last prekeys (#2694)

* Fix `make clean` (#2965, #2978)

* Make ID tags more readable by expanding abbreviations to full names. (#2991)

* Unused old swagger code removed from stern and team features (#3017)

* Refactor Writetime from Int64 to wrapper of UTCTime (#2994)

* Restructure docs.wire.com (#2986)

* Fixed flaky team user search integration test (#2996)


# [2023-01-12] (Chart Release 4.30.0)

## Release notes


* This realease migrates data from `galley.member_client` to `galley.mls_group_member_client`. When upgrading wire-server no manual steps are required. (#2859)

* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-12-19-production.0-v0.31.9-0-6b2f2bf (#2302)


## API changes


* - The endpoints `POST /conversations/list` and `GET /conversations` have been removed. Use `POST /conversations/list-ids` followed by `POST /conversations/list` instead.
  - The endpoint `PUT /conversations/:id/access` has been removed. Use its qualified counterpart instead.
  - The field `access_role_v2` in the `Conversation` type, in the request body of `POST /conversations`, and in the request body of `PUT /conversations/:domain/:id/access` has been removed. Its content is now contained in the `access_role` field instead. It replaces the legacy access role, previously contained in the `access_role` field.
  - Clients implementing the V3 API must be prepared to handle a change in the format of the conversation.access_update event. Namely, the field access_role_v2 has become optional. When missing, its value is to be found in the field access_role. (#2841)

* Added a domain parameter to the typing indicator status update API (#2892)

* Support MLS self-conversations via a new endpoint `GET /conversations/mls-self`. This removes the `PUT` counterpart introduced in #2730 (#2839)

* List the MLS self-conversation automatically without needing to call `GET /conversations/mls-self` first (#2856)

* Fail early in galley when the MLS removal key is not configured (#2899)

* Introduce a flag in brig to enable MLS explicitly. When this flag is set to false or absent, MLS functionality is completely disabled and all MLS endpoints fail immediately. (#2913)

* Conversation events may have a "subconv" field for events that originate in a MLS subconversation (#2933)

* `GET /system/settings/unauthorized` returns a curated set of system settings from brig. The endpoint is reachable without authentication/authorization. It's meant to be used by apps to adjust their behavior (e.g. to show a registration dialog if registrations are enabled on the backend.) Currently, only the `setRestrictUserCreation` flag is exported. Other options may be added in future (in consultation with the security department.) (#2903)


## Features


* The coturn Helm chart now has a `.tls.ciphers` option to allow setting
  the cipher list for TLS connections, when TLS is enabled. By default,
  this option is set to a cipher list which is compliant with [BSI
  TR-02102-2](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-2.pdf). (#2924)

* **Nginz helm chart**: The list of upstreams is split into `nginx_conf.upstreams` and
  `nginx_conf.extra_upstreams`. Extra upstreams are disabled by default. They can
  be enabled by adding their name (entry's key) to
  `nginx_conf.enabled_extra_upstreams`. `nginx_conf.ignored_upstreams` is only
  applied to upstreams from `nginx_conf.upstreams`. In the default configuration
  of `nginz` extra upstreams are `ibis`, `galeb`, `calling-test` and `proxy`. If one
  of those is deployed, its name has be be added to
  `nginx_conf.enabled_extra_upstreams` (otherwise, it won't be reachable). Unless
  `nginx_conf.upstreams` hasn't been changed manually (overriding its default),
  this should be the only needed migration step. (#2849)

* A team member's role can now be provisioned via SCIM (#2851, #2855)

* Team search endpoint now supports pagination (#2898, #2895)

* Introduce optional disabledAPIVersions configuration setting (#2951)

* Add more logs to SMTP mail sending. Ensure that logs are written before the application fails due to SMTP misconfiguration. (#2818)

* Added typing indicator status propagation to federated environments (#2892)

* Allow vhost style addressing for S3 as path style is not supported for newer buckets.

## Bug fixes and other updates


* Fix typo for Servicemonitor enable var in default values for helm charts. (#2896)

* The parser for the AWS/SNS error message to explain that an endpoint is already in use was incorrect. This lead to an "invalid token" error when registering push tokens for multiple user accounts (user ids) instead of updating the SNS endpoint with an additional user id. (#2921)

* Avoid client deletion edge case condition which can lead to inconsistent data between brig and galley's clients tables. (#2830)

* Conversations inside events are now serialised using the format of API V2 (#2971)

* Do not throw 500 when listing conversations and MLS is not configured (#2893)

* Do not list MLS self-conversation in client API v1 and v2 if it exists (#2872)

* Limit 2FA code retries to 3 attempts (#2960)

* Fix bug in MLS user removal from conversation: the list of removed clients has to be compared with those in the conversation, not the list of *all* clients of that user (#2817)

* Due to `sftd` changing how configuration is handled for "multi-SFT" calling (starting with version 3.1.10), new options have been added to the `sftd` Helm chart for compatibility with these newer versions. (#2886)

* For sftd/coturn/restund, fixed a bug in external ip address lookup, in case Kubernetes Node Name doesn't equal hostname. (#2837)

* Requesting a new token with the client_id now works correctly when the old token is part of the request (#2860)


## Documentation


* Add extra section to the deeplink docs to explain the socks proxy support while login. (#2885)

* Describe the auth cookie throttling mechanism. And overhaul the description of auth cookies in general. (#2941)

* PR guidelines docs are updated with correct helm configuration syntax (#2889)


## Internal changes


* Log AWS / SNS invalid token responses. This is helpful for native push notification debugging purposes. (#2908)

* Add tests for invitation urls in team invitation responses. These depend on the settings of galley. (#2797)

* brig: Allow multiple threads to run simultaneously (#2972)

* Remove support for compiling local docker images with buildah. Nix is used to build docker images these days (#2822)

* Nix-created docker images: add some debugging tools in the containers, and add 'make build-image-<packagename>' for convenience (#2829)

* Added typeclasses to track uses of federated calls across the codebase. (#2940)

* Split galley API routes and handler definitions into several modules (#2820)

* Default intraListing to true. This means that the list of clients, so far saved in both brig's and galley's databases, will still be written to both, but only read from brig's database. This avoids cases where these two tables go out of sync. Brig becomes the source of truth for clients. In the future, if this holds, code and data for galley's clients table can be removed. (#2847)

* Introduce the `MakesFederatedCall` Servant combinator (#2950)

* Bump nixpkgs to latest unstable. Stop using forked nixpkgs. (#2828)

* Optimize memory usage while creating large conversations (#2970)

* Reduce Polysemy-induced high memory requirements (#2947)

* Brig calling API is now migrated to servant (#2815)

* Fixed flaky feature TTL integration test (#2823)

* Brig teams API is now migrated to servant (#2824)

* Add 'inconsistencies' tool to check for, and repair certain kinds of data inconsistencies across different cassandra tables. (#2840)

* Backoffice Swagger 2.x docs is exposed on `/` and the old Swagger has been removed. Backoffice helm chart only runs stern without an extra nginx. (#2846)

* Give proxy service a servant routing table for swagger (not for replacing wai-route; see comments in source code) (#2848)

* Stern API endpoint `GET ejpd-info` has now the correct HTTP method (#2850)

* External commits: add additional checks (#2852)

* Golden tests for conversation and feature config event schemas (#2861)

* Add startup probe to brig helm chart. (#2878)

* Track federated calls in types across the codebase. (#2940)

* Update nix pins to point at polysemy-1.8.0.0 (#2949)

* Add MakesFederatedCall combinators to Galley (#2957)

* Fix `make clean`; allow new data constructors in `ToSchema Version` instance (#2965)

* Refactor and simplify MLS message handling logic (#2844)

* Remove cassandra queries to the user_keys_hash table, as they are never read anymore since 'onboarding' / auto-connect was removed in https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/pull/1005 (#2902)

* Replay external backend proposals after forwarding external commits.
  One column added to Galley's mls_proposal_refs. (#2842)

* Remove an unused effect for remote conversation listing (#2954)

* Introduce types for subconversations (#2925)

* Use treefmt to ensure consistent formatting of .nix files, use for shellcheck too (#2831)


## Federation changes


* Honour MLS flag in brig's federation API (#2946)

* Split the Proteus and MLS message sending requests into separate types. The MLS request now supports MLS subconversations. This is a federation API breaking change. (#2925)

* Injects federated calls into the `x-wire-makes-federated-calls-to` extension of the swagger Operations (#2950)


# [2022-12-09] (Chart Release 4.29.0)

## Bug fixes and other updates

* Prevention of storing unnecessary data in the database if adding a bot to a conversation fails. (#2870)

## Internal changes

* bump nginx-module-vts from v0.1.15 to v0.2.1 (#2827)
* Build nginz and nginz_disco docker images using nix (#2796)

# [2022-11-03] (Chart Release 4.26.0)

## Release notes


* If you have not upgraded to [release 2021-03-21 (Chart Release 2.103.0)](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases/tag/v2021-03-21) yet, please do that now!

  NB: we only support releases 6 months back, so this should not be an issue.  But in this particular case we are positive that things will break if you don't do an intermediate upgrade. (#2768)

* Build docker images using nix derivations instead of Dockerfiles (#2331, #2771, #2772, #2775, #2776)

* Upgrade team-settings version to 4.13.0-v0.31.5-0-4754212 (#2180)

* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-11-02-production.0-v0.31.9-0-337e400 (#2302)

* The experimental wire-server-metrics helm chart has been removed.

  These were mostly a wrapper around prometheus operator. It makes more sense to
  refer to the upstream docs of Prometheus Operator or Grafana Agent Operator for
  installation instead. (#2740)


## API changes


* Do not expose swagger-ui on prod systems (to minimize attack surface) (#2800)

* Change mime type of body of /v3/mls/commit-bundles endpoint (#2773)

* Stop rate-limiting asset-signed-url requests on /assets/.* (#2786)

* The `/access` endpoint now takes an optional `client_id` query parameter. The first time it is provided, a new user token will be generated containing the given client ID. Successive invocations of `/access` will ignore the `client_id` parameter. Some endpoints can now potentially require a client ID as part of the access token. When trying to invoke them with an access token that does not contain a client ID, an authentication error will occur. (#2764)


## Features


* Introduce support for external commits in MLS (#2765)

* The `GET /teams/{tid}/members` endpoint now supports pagination (#2802)


## Bug fixes and other updates


* Clients without any prekeys are not deleted completely (#2758)


## Documentation


* tentatively allow `GET /api/event-notification-schemas` for json schemas of server-initiated events (missing pieces tracked in https://wearezeta.atlassian.net/browse/FS-1008) (#2739)

* Fix copyright date on docs.wire.com (#2792)

* Improve and cross-link documentation on SNS / push notifications. (#PR_NOT_FOUND)

* Add extension sphinx-reredirects and configuration to generate simple JavaScript based redirects to new locations of previously inconsistently named files/URLs. (#2811)


## Internal changes


* Convert brig's auth endpoints to servant (#2750)

* Remove deprecated table for storing scim external_ids.

  Data has been migrated away in [release 2021-03-21 (Chart Release 2.103.0)](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases/tag/v2021-03-21) (see `/services/spar/migrate-data/src/Spar/DataMigration/V1_ExternalIds.hs`); last time it has been touched in production is before upgrade to [release 2021-03-23 (Chart Release 2.104.0)](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases/tag/v2021-03-23). (#2768)

* Refactor some internal Scim user tests (#2762)

* Reduce the payload size of internal `client.delete` event (#2807, #2816)

* Bump servant-swagger-ui package. (#2747)

* Increase charts/galley memory limit to 500M. (#2798)

* Add RPC, ServiceRPC and GalleyProvider effects to brig (#2653)

* Use locally build schema binaries for db migrations and execute them right before running integration tests. (#2791)

* Rename the make targets from `db-migrate-package` and `db-reset-package` to `db-migrate` and `db-reset` and allow migrating and resetting all keyspaces. (#2791)

* Add a Make target for ghci (#2749)

* Upgrade nginz/nginx to 1.22.1 (#2777)

* The dev environment provided by nix now contains all the haskell packages
  compiled by nix. This could casue linker errors while compiling haskell code in
  this repo. One way to get resolve them is to delete the 'dist-newstyle'
  directory. (#2331)

* Implemented a new intersperse combinator for Polysemy (#2767)

* Add a Concurrency effect for Polysemy (#2748)

* Don't fail client deletion when mls remove key is undefined (#2738)

* Migrate stern to swagger2-ui (remaining backwards compatible with circulating backoffice images) (see also #2742 from last release) (#2744)

* Gundeck push token API and notification API is migrated to Servant (#2769)

* Delete `deploy/services-demo` directory (#2789)

* Upgrade Servant to 0.19 (#2809)


# [2022-10-04] (Chart Release 4.25.0)

## Release notes


* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-10-04-production.0-v0.31.2-0-a438b30 (#2302)


## API changes


* Remove /legalhold/conversation alias from v2 (#2734)

* Make v2 a supported version and start v3 (#2734)


## Features


* Allow deletion of MLS team conversations (#2733)


## Bug fixes and other updates


* Revert synchronous semantics of client deletion endpoint (#2737)


## Documentation


* JCT-146 - update outdated info
  SER-211 - update new info regarding nodetool use (#2736)


## Internal changes


* Skeleton implementation of new endpoint for JWT DPoP access token generation (#2652, #2686)

* Add swagger2-ui to stern (#2742 ...)


# [2022-09-27] (Chart Release 4.24.0)

## Release notes


* For users of the (currently alpha) coturn Helm chart, **manual action is
  required** when upgrading to this version. The labels applied to the Kubernetes
  manifests in this chart have changed, in order to match the conventions used
  in the wire-server charts. However, this may mean that upgrading with Helm can
  fail, due to changes to the `StatefulSet` included in this chart -- in this
  case, the `StatefulSet` must be deleted before the chart is upgraded. (#2677)

* wire-server helm charts: Adjust default CPU/Memory resources: Remove CPU limits to avoid CPU throttling; adjust request CPU and memory based on observed values. Overall this decreases the amount of CPU/memory that the wire-server chart needs to install/schedule pods. (#2675)

* Upgrade team-settings version to 4.12.1-v0.31.5-0-0167ea4 (#2180)

* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-09-20-production.0-v0.31.2-0-7f74074 (#2302)


## API changes


* Add new endpoint `/mls/commit-bundles` for submitting MLS `CommitBundle`s. A `CommitBundle` is a triple consisting of a commit message, an optional welcome message and a public group state. (#2688)

* MLS: Store and expose group info via `GET /conversations/:domain/:id/groupinfo` (#2721)

* Add /mls/public-keys to nginz chart (#2676)

* Users being kicked out results in member-leave events originating from the user who caused the change in the conversation (#2724)

* Leaving an MLS conversation is now possible using the regular endpoint `DELETE /conversations/{cnv_domain}/{cnv}/members/{usr_domain}/{usr}`. When a user leaves, the backend sends external remove proposals for all their clients in the corresponding MLS group. (#2667)

* Validate remotely claimed key packages (#2692)


## Features


* The coturn chart now has support for exposing its metric endpoint with a
  ServiceMonitor, which can be ingested by third-party metrics collection tools. (#2677)

* Deleting clients creates MLS remove proposals (#2674)

* External remove proposals are now sent to a group when a user is deleted (#2650)

* Allow non-admins to commit add proposals in MLS conversations (#2691)

* Optionally add invitation urls to the body of `/teams/{tid}/invitations`. This allows further processing; e.g. to send those links with custom emails or distribute them as QR codes. See [docs](https://docs.wire.com/developer/reference/config-options.html#expose-invitation-urls-to-team-admin) for details and privacy implications. (#2684)


## Bug fixes and other updates


* SCIM user deletion suffered from a couple of race conditions. The user in now first deleted in spar, because this process depends on data from brig. Then, the user is deleted in brig. If any error occurs, the SCIM deletion request can be made again. This change depends on brig being completely deployed before using the SCIM deletion endpoint in brig. In the unlikely event of using SCIM deletion during the deployment, these requests can be retried (in case of error). (#2637)

* The 2nd factor password challenge team feature is disabled for SSO users (#2693)

* Less surprising handling of SIGINT, SIGTERM for proxy, stern. Increase grace period for shutdown from 5s to 30s for all services.  (#2715)


## Documentation


* Drop Client model (unused) from old swagger.
  Add a description and example data for mls_public_keys field in new swagger. (#2657)

* Document user deactivation (aka suspension) with SCIM. (#2720)

* Monitoring page showed wrong wrong configuration charts. Updated prometheus-operator to kube-prometheus-stack chart in the documentation.  (#2708)


## Internal changes


* Make client deletion asynchronous (#2669)

* Allow external add proposals without previously uploading key packages. (#2661)

* Allow legalhold tokens access to `/converations/<uuid>` endpoint (#2682, #2726)

* Move Brig.Sem.* modules to Brig.Effects (consistency) (#2672)

* The labels applied to resources in the coturn chart have been changed to
  reflect the conventions in the wire-server charts. (#2677)

* Drop the `managed` column from `team_conv` table in Galley (#2127)

* Fix link in PR template (#2673)

* In Gundeck's 'notifications' cassandra table, switch to [TWCS](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/operating/compaction/twcs.html) compaction strategy, which should be more efficient for this workload, and possibly bring performance benefits to latencies.
  It may be beneficial to run a manual compaction before rolling out this
  change (but things should also work without this manual operation).
  In case you have time, run the following from a cassandra machine before deploying this update: `nodetool compact gundeck notifications`. (#2615)

* Add regular expression support to libzauth ACL language (#2714)

* Make test API calls point to the most recent version by default (#2695)

* Clients and key package refs in an MLS conversation are now stored in their own table. (#2667)

* Refactor MLS test framework (#2678)

* Update mls-test-cli to version 0.5 (#2685)

* Added rusty-jwt-tools to docker images (#2686)

* The account API is now migrated to servant. (#2699, #2700, #2701, #2702, #2703, #2704, #2705, #2707)

* Update nginz and cannon ACLs to match api-versioned paths (#2725)

* For wire-server cloud, on kubernetes 1.21+, favour topology-aware routing, which reduces unnecessary inter-availability-zone traffic, reducing latency and cloud provider cross-AZ traffic costs. (#2723)


# [2022-09-01] (Chart Release 4.23.0)

## Release notes


* The internal endpoint `GET i/mls/clients` has been changed, and it now returns a list of `ClientInfo` instead of a list of `ClientId`. (#2631)


## API changes

## Bug fixes and other updates


* Fix cql-io bug where restarting whole cassandra cluster could cause downtime. Upstream changes in https://gitlab.com/twittner/cql-io/-/merge_requests/20 (#2640)

* Improve client check when adding clients to MLS conversations (#2631)


## Documentation


* Move developer docs onto docs.wire.com (instead of exposing them on github only) (#2622, #2649)

* Make target audience explicit on docs.wire.com (#2662)


## Internal changes


* Support for external Add proposals (#2567)

  * if the group ID of a remote conversation matches the local mapping (#2618)

* Apply changes introduced by cabal-fmt. (#2624)

* Remove some redudant constraints in brig (#2638)

* Brig Polysemy: Port UserPendingActivationStore to polysemy (#2636)

* Move Paging effect from galley into polysemy-wire-zoo (#2648)

* Fix broken hls-hlint-plugin in nix env (#2629)

* Adjust developer PR template and document config and API procedures in-tree. (#2617)

# [2022-08-16] (Chart Release 4.22.0)

## API changes


* Drop the deprecated member removal endpoint (#2593)


## Features


* charts/cannon: Ensure HSTS headers are set for all endpoints (#2574)

* Expired MLS key packages are deleted from the database (#2582)

* Add support for MLS Remove proposals (#2561)

* Human readable names for SAML IdPs (#2565)

* The `preferredLanguage` field from SCIM now maps to the user locale in BRIG and will be set and updated on post SCIM user and on update SCIM user using SAML. (#2605)

* For TLS1.2, by default, remove ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 and ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 ciphers for ingress traffic. (#2528)


## Bug fixes and other updates


* Allow deleting existing splash screens in `PUT /teams/:tid (see also PR#2474 in Release 4.18.0) (#2588)

* Backoffice: Fix an issue where in some deployments ibis/galeb (Wire Cloud internal services) are unreachable from backoffice if deployed in a different namespace. (#2610)

* Fix an issue for larger client requests on e.g. /list-users and /list-conversations, which were giving 413 errors for some users. Allow client requests of 256k by default (was 64k). (#2579)


## Internal changes


* Add shellcheck, libstdc++ to nix env; handle emacs auto-save files better (#2609)

* Allow features to be set with HTTP method PATCH. This reflects a prior behavior
  that is used by Ibis. Additionally, it's more consistent when all setters can be
  called with PUT and PATCH. As this will fix calls by Ibis, the deployment order
  doesn't matter. (#2575)

* Brig Polysemization: introduce BlacklistStore and BlacklistPhonePrefixStore effects (#2590)

* Add cabal-fmt development tool (#2601)

* Reformat all cabal files with cabal-fmt (#2603)

* Delete tools: bonanza and makedeb (#2600)

* No more package.yaml / hpack, and stick with cabal files as the single (and only) source of truth (#2596)

* Port Brig SearchAPI and UserRichInfo endpoints to Servant (#2580)

* Added TTL data to stern feature flag GET endpoint. (#2564)

* Prepare removing deprecated non-binding teams (no more used in integration tests) (#2514, #2607)

## Federation changes


* Fix TBS field in MLS Message type (#2599)


# [2022-07-19] (Chart Release 4.21.0)

## Release notes


* Users of the (currently alpha) coturn Helm chart must **manually update
  their configuration** due to changes in how the chart handles authentication
  secrets. Please see below for further details. (#2553)


## API changes


* The response to POST /mls/messages adds a timestamp (#2560)


## Features


* charts/wire-server: default log format everywhere to StructuredJSON format (introduced in #1951 and #1959) (#2559)

* The coturn chart now supports multiple authentication secrets, which permits
  multiple backend instances to use the same TURN servers without needing to
  share authentication secrets between the backend instances.

  Correspondingly, the `.Values.secrets.zrestSecret` configuration option, which
  took a single authentication secret as its argument, has been replaced with the
  option `.Values.secrets.zrestSecrets` (note spelling!), which instead takes a
  *list* of authentication secrets as its argument. (#2553)

* Add support for bare MLS proposals (#2436)


## Bug fixes and other updates


* Fix a bug in charts/cannon. It's now possible to use a custom TLS certificate when enabling cannon's nginz sidecar container. (Previously only letsencrypt certificates worked, and were tested) (#2558)

* Minor fixes in helmcharts:
  - charts/nginz: Rate limit SSO endpoints less
  - charts/nginz: Ensure rate limiting isn't commented out
  - charts/galley: Honour .setttings.httpPoolSize
  - charts/galley: Fix typo in settings.featureFlags.validateSAMLEmails
  - charts/gundeck: Remove aws.connectionLimit
  - charts/brig: Fix default brandLabelUrl and remove brandLabel (#2563)

* Bump saml2-web-sso (#2545, #2546)

* use checkedConnectCluster to avoid dropping requests to Redis when Gundeck reconnects to the Redis cluster (#2542)

* Do not log polysemy errors in Galley (#2531)

* Remove old crypto-cli tool from the ubuntu image (#2538)


## Federation changes


* Added new-remote-conversation RPC, used to notify a backend of a remote conversation the first time any user from that backend is added to it. (#2378)

* Added federation endpoint `send-mls-message` used to send messages to remote converesations (#2378)


# [2022-07-05] (Chart Release 4.18.0)

## Release notes


* For users of the (currently alpha) coturn Helm chart:
  **manual intervention may be required** when upgrading to
  this version of the chart from a prior version, due to [a bug in
  Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/39188) which
  may interfere with applying changes to pod and service port configuration
  correctly.

  If, after updating this chart, the coturn pods do not have both a `coturn-udp`
  port and a `coturn-tcp` port, then the coturn `StatefulSet` must be manually
  deleted from the cluster, and then recreated by re-running Helm. Similarly, if
  the coturn `Service` does not have both a `coturn-udp` port and a `coturn-tcp`
  port, this `Service` must also be deleted and recreated. (#2500)

* The `nginz{-tcp,-http}` services have been unified into a `nginz` service, and
  moved into the nginz chart.

  The nginz-ingress-services chart simply targets the `nginz` service, so there's
  no need to set matching `service.nginz.external{Http,Tcp}Port` inside the
  `nginx-ingress-services` chart anymore.

  The `config.http.httpPort` and `config.ws.wsPort` values in the `nginz` chart
  still configure the ports the `nginz` service is listening on.

  Metrics were moved from `config.http.httpPort` to a new `http-metrics` port.

  The `nginz` chart also gained support for `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled`,
  creating a `ServiceMonitor` resource to scrape metrics, like for other wire
  services.

  (#2476)

* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-06-30-production.0-v0.30.5-0-3e2aaf6 (#2302)

* In the helm charts, the `wireService` label has been removed.

  In some cases, we were already setting the `app` label too.

  Now we consistently use the `app` label to label different wire services.

  The `wireService` label was also used in the `spec.selector.matchLabels` field
  on existing `Deployment` / `StatefulSet` resources.
  As these fields being immutable, changing them isn't possible without recreation.

  If you encounter an issue like

  > field is immutable && cannot patch "*" with kind *

  you need to manually delete these StatefulSet and Deployment resources, and apply helm again, which will recreate them.

  This means downtime, so plan a maintenance window for it.

  The `wire-server-metrics` chart was previously running some custom
  configuration to automatically add all payloads with a `wireService` label into
  metrics scraping.

  With the removal of the `wireService` label, this custom configuration has been
  removed.

  Instead, all services that expose metrics will now create `ServiceMonitor`
  resources, if their helm chart is applied with `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled`
  set to true.

  This prevents scraping agents from querying services that don't expose metrics
  at /i/metrics unnecessarily.

  Additionally, makes it easier to run other metric scraping operators, like
  `grafana-agent-operator`, without the need to also create some custom
  `wireService` label config there.

  Generally, if you have any monitoring solution installed in your cluster that
  uses the Prometheus CRDs, set `metrics.serviceMonitor.enable` for the following charts:

   - brig
   - cannon
   - cargohold
   - galley
   - gundeck
   - proxy
   - spar (#2413)


## API changes


* The request body of `POST /conversations` endpoint can now contain an optional `creator_client` field. The `creator_client` field is only relevant for MLS conversations, in which case it must be set to the ID of the client making the request. (#2486)

* Retire deprecated feature config API endpoints for API version V2 (#2492)


## Features


* Prevent race conditions in concurrent MLS commit requests. (#2525)

* charts/wire-server: Optionally include backoffice (#2490)

* The coturn chart has new functionality to enable graceful pod termination, by
  waiting for all active allocations on a coturn instance to drain first. When
  combined with a suitable external service discovery mechanism which can steer
  client traffic away from terminating coturn pods, this can be used to implement
  graceful rolling restarts of clusters of coturn instances. (#2456)

* `./deploy/services-demo/create_team_members.sh` creates users with given roles now (#2137)

* MLS implementation progress:
   - Remote users can be added to MLS conversations
   - MLS messages (both handshake and application) are now propagates to remote
     conversation participants. (#2415)

* charts/nginz: Serve swagger-ui for viewing swagger-1.2 docs (#2466)

* `GET teams/:tid` response now contains an optional field `splash_screen` which contains the asset key of the team's splash screen. `PUT teams/:tid` now supports updating the splash screen asset key. (#2474)

* Missing feature config mapping added (#2494)

* Add MLS team feature configuration (#2499)

* Team feature API now includes endpoints to get and set the `searchVisibilityInbound` feature (#2503)


## Bug fixes and other updates


* charts/backoffice: Fix version of frontend and auto-bump version of stern on every release (#2490)

* The service definitions in the coturn Helm chart were missing the control plane
  UDP port used by coturn. (#2500)

* In nginx-ingress-services chart, when enabling useCertManager, now correctly creates the required issuer by default. (#2532)

* Fix handling of creator client in MLS conversations (#2486)

* Fix all clients having the same MLS public key (#2501)

* A user now cannot delete an identity provider that they are authenticated with any more (#2519)


## Internal changes


* brig-types: remove all re-exports (#2505)

* charts/nginz: Forward `/i/legalhold/whitelisted-teams` to galley instead of brig (#2460)

* make the ldap-scim-bridge chart deployable once per team, and improve docs. (#1843)

* Refactored and simplified the feature config API (#2435)

* Removed deprecated internal feature config API endpoints (#2496)

* Deactivated gundeck's integration tests for local steps (`make ci`). (#2510)

* retry gundeck's Redis connection in case of network errors such as IP changes or network outages (#2512)

* Add AWS security token metrics to all services (#2473)


# [2022-06-14] (Chart Release 4.14.0)

## Release notes


* Upgrade team-settings version to 4.10.0-v0.29.7-0-3be8ca3 (#2180)

* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-06-13-production.0-v0.29.7-0-2819b90 (#2302)


## Documentation


* Docs for guest links server and team feature settings added (#2480)

## Internal changes


* All feature configs like guest links e.g. can now be overridden in the helm configuration, so that they can be disabled/enabled and configured server wide (#2479)



# [2022-06-08] (Chart Release 4.13.0)

## Release notes


* The `.cannon.drainTimeout` setting on the wire-server helm chart has been
  removed and replaced with `.cannon.config.drainOpts`. (#2416)

* Note for wire.com operators: deploy nginz (#2439)


## API changes


* The back-office (aka stern) team feature API now accenpts an optional TTL parameter (in days), so features can be activated for a limited period. (#2417)

* Disable rate limiting for /api-version (#2439)


## Features


* Drain websockets in a controlled fashion when cannon receives a SIGTERM or
  SIGINT. Instead of waiting for connections to close on their own, the websockets
  are now severed at a controlled pace. This allows for quicker rollouts of new
  versions. (#2416)

* Optionally allow to run cannon with its own nginz inside the same pod; and connect to a load balancer directly.
  This allows the cannon-slow-drain behaviour implemented in #2416 to take effect by not having other intermediate network hops which could break websocket connections all at once.
  Some (internal) context: https://wearezeta.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PS/pages/585564424/How+to+gracefully+drain+cannon+but+not+so+slowly
  For details on how to configure this, see docs/src/how-to/install/configuration-options.rst (#2421)

  /self/consent and /signatures endpoints are configured in all environments (#2457)

* When an IdP issuer (aka entity ID) is updated, the old issuer was still marked as "in use". (#2400)

* On actions that require re-authentication a password is not required if the user has SAML credentials (#2430, #2434, #2437)

* Use SCIM's preferred language as a fallback when privisioning users without a locale. (#2445)

* charts/{nginz,cannon}: Increase map_hash_bucket_size for nginx to 128 (#2443)

* charts/{cannon,nginz}: values listed in
  `nginx_conf.randomport_allowlisted_origins` must be full hostnames. Hostnames
  listed here will be allowlisted with and without TLS. (#2438)

* Remove binding of users to saml idps using saml (this has never been picked up by clients; use scim instead) (#2441)

* Remove golden test case generator

   (#2442)

* Convert Team CSV endpoint to Servant (#2419)


## Federation changes


* Send only the raw welcome message in the Galley "mls-welcome" federation endpoint (#2412)


# [2022-05-18] (Chart Release 4.12.0)

## Release notes


* If using [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager), you need to have least version 1.0.0 (1.8.0 works at the time of writing) installed. Older cert-manager 0.15.X will no longer work. (#2401)

* Upgrade team-settings version to 4.9.0-v0.29.7-0-142a76f (#2180)


## API changes


* Start version 2 of the public API. Main changes:

   - Asset endpoints have lost their `v3` and `v4` suffixes. So for example
     `/assets/v3` has been replaced by `/assets`.
   - `GET /conversations/:conv/assets/:id` and `GET
     /conversations/:conv/otr/assets/:id` have been removed.
   - `GET /assets/:key/v3` has been removed. Use the qualified endpoint `GET
     /assets/:domain/:key` instead.
   - `DELETE /assets/:key/v3` has been removed. Use the qualified endpoint
     `DELETE /assets/:domain/:key` instead.
   - `GET /connections` has been removed. Use `POST /list-connections` instead.
   - `POST /connections` has been removed. Use `POST /connections/:domain/:user` instead.
   - `PUT /connections/:domain/:user` has been removed: use `POST` instead.
   - `GET /conversations` has been removed. Use `POST /conversations/list-ids`
     followed by `POST /conversations/list` instead.
   - `POST /conversations/list/v2` has been replaced by `POST
     /conversations/list`.
   - `POST /conversations/:domain/:conv/members/v2` has lost its `v2` suffix, so
     it is now `POST /conversations/:domain/:conv/members`.
   - `GET /users`, `GET /users/by-handle` and `GET /users/handles` have been
     removed. Use `POST /search/contacts` instead.
   - `GET /users/:id` has been removed. Use the qualified endpoint `GET
     /users/:domain/:id` instead.
   - `GET /users/:id/clients` has been removed. Use the qualified endpoint `GET
     /users/:domain/:id/clients` instead.
   - `GET /users/:id/clients/:client` has been removed. Use the qualified
     endpoint `GET /users/:domain/:id/clients/:client` instead.

  Swagger documentation for the previous version of the API can be accessed at
  `/v1/api/swagger-ui`. (#2297)

* A new field `development` has been added to the object returned by `GET
  /api-version`. Versions listed there are considered in flux, meaning that the
  corresponding API contracts can change arbitrarily over time. Clients are free
  to use development versions, as long as they are also listed in `supported`,
  and failures due to incompatibilities are acceptable (e.g. in testing
  environments). Backends are the authoritative source on whether a development
  version can be used at all. If a development version should not be used, the
  backend will not list it among the supported versions at all. (#2297)


## Features


* charts: Various new values can now be configured and some got changed

  Allow new configurations in the brig chart:
  * `config.emailSMS.user.invitationUrl`
  * `config.emailSMS.team.tInvitationUrl`
  * `config.emailSMS.team.tActivationUrl`
  * `config.emailSMS.team.tCreatorWelcomeUrl`
  * `config.emailSMS.team.tMemberWelcomeUrl`
  * `config.setProviderSearchFilter`
  * `config.setWhitelist`
  * `config.setFeatureFlags`
  * `config.setCustomerExtensions`

  * `config.perNativePushConcurrency`
  * `config.maxConcurrentNativePushes.soft`
  * `config.maxConcurrentNativePushes.hard`

  Other changes:
  * Default `maxTeamSize` changed to 10000 from 500. (#2347)

* charts/nginx-ingress-services: Allow more fine-grained control over what services are installed. Upgrade Certificate/Issuer resources to 'cert-manager.io/v1' (#2401)

* MLS implementation progress:

   - remote key package claim is now supported (#2353)

* charts/{brig,cargohold,galley,gundeck}: Allow not configuring AWS credentials and allow using a special service account.
  This way, when operating wire in AWS cloud either instance profiles or IAM role attached to a service account can be used to communicate with AWS. (#2347)

* Implement TURN service discovery using SRV records (#2389)


## Bug fixes and other updates


* When `config.enablePayment` and `FEATURE_ENABLE_PAYMENT` (`envVars`) were set,
  the team-settings feature flag `FEATURE_ENABLE_PAYMENT` was rendered two times.
  The new behavior is to give the `envVars` entry priority. I.e. when it's set,
  it's used instead of the `config.enablePayment` value. (#2332)

* Modify the nginz access control configuration to prevent clients connecting
  to listeners with PROXY protocol enabled (such as the websocket listener) from
  accessing a private metrics endpoint. (#2307)

* Verification email is sent when external id is updated via SCIM (#2374)

   - MLS/Proteus mismatches (e.g. sending a proteus message to an MLS conversation) are now handled (#2278)
   - the `POST /mls/key-packages/claim` endpoint gained a `skip_own` query parameter, which can be used to avoid claiming a key package for the requesting client itself (#2287)

* The user profiles that are returned by a team admin search now contain the additional fields SAML NameID, IdP Issuer, and SCIM externalId (#2213), and  unvalidated email address (#2220)

## Bug fixes and other updates


* Conversation rename endpoints now return 204 instead of 404 when the conversation name is unchanged (#2239)

* Revert temporary sftd bump (#2230)


## Internal changes


* Remove the MonadMask instance for AppT in Brig (#2259)

* Remove the MonadUnliftIO instance for the app monad in Brig (#2233)

* Bump hsaml2 version (#2221)

* Fix: cabal-install-artefacts.sh fails if not run from root of wire-server (#2236)

* Fix: pushing to cachix not working (#2257)

* Cannon has been fully migrated to Servant (#2243)

* Refactor conversation record and conversation creation functions. This removes a lot of duplication and makes the types of protocol-specific data in a conversation tighter. (#2234)

   - Move conversation name size check to `NewConv`
   - Make the `NewConversation` record (used as input to the data
     function creating a conversation) contain a `ConversationMetadata`.
   - Implement all "special" conversation creation in terms of a general `createConversation`
   - Move protocol field from metadata to Conversation
   - Restructure MLS fields in Conversation record
   - Factor out metadata fields from Data.Conversation

* Fix Docs: real-world domain used in examples (#2238)

* The `CanThrow` combinator can now be used to set the corresponding error effects in polysemy handlers. (#2239)

* Most error effects in Galley are now defined at the granularity of single error values. For example, a handler throwing `ConvNotFound` will now directly declare `ConvNotFound` (as a promoted constructor) among its error effects, instead of the generic `ConversationError` that was used before. Correspondingly, all such fine-grained Galley errors have been moved to wire-api as constructors of a single enumerated type `GalleyError`, and similarly for Brig, Cannon and Cargohold. (#2239)

* Add a column for MLS clients to the Galley member table (#2245)

* Pin direnv version in nix-hls.sh script (#2232)

* nginx-ingress-services chart: allow for custom challenge solvers (#2222, #2229)

* Remove unused debian Makefile targets (#2237)

* Use local serial consistency for Cassandra lightweight transactions (#2251)


# [2022-03-30] (Chart Release 4.8.0)

## Release notes

* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552 (#2246)
# [2022-03-18] (Chart Release 4.7.0)

## Release notes

* Deploy Brig before Spar. (#2149)
* If you are in a federated network of backends (currently beta), you need to update all participating instances at the same time. (#2173)

## API changes

* The `client` JSON object now has an additional field `mls_public_keys`, containing an object mapping signature schemes to public keys, e.g.
  ```
  {
    ...
    "mls_public_keys": { "ed25519": "GY+t1EQu0Zsm0r/zrm6zz9UpjPcAPyT5i8L1iaY3ypM=" }
    ...
  }
  ```
  At the moment, `ed25519` is the only supported signature scheme, corresponding to MLS ciphersuite 1.

  When creating a new client with `POST /clients`, the field `mls_public_keys` can be set, and the corresponding public keys are bound to the device identity on the backend, and will be used to verify uploaded key packages with a matching signature scheme.

  When updating a client with `PUT /clients/:client`, the field `mls_public_keys` can also be set, with a similar effect. If a given signature scheme already has a public key set for that device, the request will fail. (#2147)

* Introduce an endpoint for creating an MLS conversation (#2150)

* The `/billing` and `/teams/.*/billing` endpoints are now available on a versioned path (e.g. `/v1/billing`) (#2167)


## Features


* MLS implementation progress:

   - key package refs are now mapped after being claimed (#2192)

* 2nd factor authentication via 6 digit code, sent by email:
   - for login, sent by email. The feature is disabled per default and can be enabled server or team wide. (#2142)
   - for "create SCIM token". The feature is disabled per default and can be enabled server or team wide. (#2149)
   - for "add new client" via 6 digit code, sent by email. This only happens inside the login flow (in particular, when logging in from a new device).  The code obtained for logging in is used a second time for adding the device. (#2186)
   - 2nd factor authentication for "delete team" via 6 digit code, sent by email. (#2193)
   - The `SndFactorPasswordChallenge` team feature is locked by default. (#2205)
   - Details: [/docs/reference/config-options.md#2nd-factor-password-challenge](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/develop/docs/reference/config-options.md#2nd-factor-password-challenge)

## Bug fixes and other updates


* Fix data consistency issue in import of users from TM invitation to SCIM-managed (#2201)

* Use the same context string as openmls for key package ref calculation (#2216)

* Ensure that only conversation admins can create invite links.  (Until now we have relied on clients to enforce this.) (#2211)


## Internal changes


* account-pages Helm chart: Add a "digest" image option (#2194)

* Add more test mappings (#2185)

* Internal endpoint for re-authentication (`GET "/i/users/:uid/reauthenticate"`) in brig has changed in a backwards compatible way. Spar depends on this change for creating a SCIM token with 2nd password challenge. (#2149)

* Asset keys are now internally validated. (#2162)

* Spar debugging; better internal combinators (#2214)

* Remove the MonadClient instance of the Brig monad

  - Lots of functions were generalized to run in a monad constrained by
    MonadClient instead of running directly in Brig's `AppIO r` monad. (#2187)


## Federation changes


* Refactor conversation actions to an existential type consisting of a singleton tag (identifying the action) and a dedicated type for the action itself. Previously, actions were represented by a big sum type. The new approach enables us to describe the needed effects of an action much more precisely. The existential type is initialized by the Servant endpoints in a way to mimic the previous behavior. However, the messages between services changed. Thus, all federated backends need to run the same (new) version. The deployment order itself does not matter. (#2173)


# [2022-03-09] (Chart Release 4.6.0)

## Release notes


* Upgrade team-settings version to 4.6.2-v0.29.7-0-4f43ee4 (#2180)


# [2022-03-07] (Chart Release 4.5.0)

## Release notes


* For wire.com operators: make sure that nginz is deployed (#2166)


## API changes


* Add qualified broadcast endpoint (#2166)


## Bug fixes and other updates


* Always create spar credentials during SCIM provisioning when applicable (#2174)


## Internal changes


* Add tests for additional information returned by `GET /api-version` (#2159)

* Clean up `Base64ByteString` implementation (#2170)

* The `Event` record type does not contain a `type` field anymore (#2160)

# [2022-03-01] (Chart Release 4.4.0)

## Release notes


* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-02-22-production.0-v0.29.2-0-abb34f5 (#2148)


## API changes


* The `api-version` endpoint now returns additional information about the backend:

    - whether federation is supported (field `federation`);
    - the federation domain (field `domain`).

  Note that the federation domain is always set, even if federation is disabled. (#2146)

* Add MLS key package API (#2102)


## Internal changes


* Bump aeson to v2.0.3.0 and update amazonka fork from upstream repository.  (#2153, #2157, #2163)

* Add schema-profunctor instances for `QueuedNotification` and `QueuedNotificationList` (#2161)

* Dockerfile.builder: Add cabal update (#2168)


## Federation changes


* Make restrictions on federated user search configurable by domain: `NoSearch`, `ExactHandleSearch` and `FullSearch`.
  Details about the configuration are described in [config-options.md](docs/reference/config-options.md).
  There are sane defaults (*deny to find any users as long as there is no other configuration for the domain*), so no measures have to be taken by on-premise customers (unless the default is not the desired behavior). (#2087)


# [2022-02-21] (Chart Release 4.2.0)

## Release notes

* Upgrade team-settings version to 4.6.1-v0.29.3-0-28cbbd7 (#2106)
* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-02-08-production.0-v0.29.2-0-4d437bb (#2107)
* Change the default set of TLS ciphers (both for the client and the federation APIs) to be compliant to the recommendations of [TR-02102-2](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-2.html). (#2112)
* For wire.com operators: make sure that nginz is deployed. (#2116, #2124)
* Optional team feature config `validateSAMLEmails` added to galley.yaml.
  The feature was disabled by default before this release and is now enabled by default. The server wide default can be changed in galley.yaml. Please refer to [/docs/reference/config-options.md#validate-saml-emails](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/develop/docs/reference/config-options.md#validate-saml-emails) (#2117)

## API changes

* Added minimal API version support: a list of supported API versions can be found at the endpoint `GET /api-version`. Versions can be selected by adding a prefix of the form `/vN` to every route, where `N` is the desired version number (so for example `/v1/conversations` to access version 1 of the `/conversations` endpoint). (#2116)
* Delete `GET /self/name` endpoint (#2101)
* New endpoint (`POST /verification-code/send`) for generating and sending a verification code for 2nd factor authentication actions. (#2124)

## Features

* Add freetext search results to "search-users" federation endpoint (#2085)

## Bug fixes and other updates

* Ensure empty responses show up without a schema in swagger. They were shown as empty arrays before. (#2104)
* Require the guest links feature is enabled when someone joins by code. (#2084)
* Escape disallowed characters at the beginning of CSV cells to prevent CSV injection vulnerability. (#2096)
* The field `icon` in the body of the `PUT /team/:tid` endpoint is now typed to prevent potential injection attacks. (#2103)

## Internal changes

* Enforce conversation access roles more tightly on the backend (was previously only enforce on client): if a guests or non-team-members are not allowed, block guest link creation (new behavior) as well as ephemeral users joining (old behavior). (#2076)
* Remove uses of servant-generics from brig (#2100, #2086)
* Migrate more API end-points to servant. (#2016, #2081, #2091)
* Introduce the row type variable in Brig monads (#2140)
* Build ubuntu20 docker images with cabal instead of stack (#2119, #2060)
* Drop managed conversations (#2125)
* To investigate issues related to push notifications, adjust Gundeck `Debug` leveled logs to not print the message itself. So, that it can safely be turned on in production environments. Add a log entry when a bulk notification is pushed to Cannon. (#2053)
* Add integration tests for scim/saml user creation (#2123)
* Wrap stack with NIX_BUILD_SHELL set to LD_LIBRARY_PATH compatible shell (#2105)
* Removed redundant `setDefaultTemplateLocale` config from the brig helm template. (#2099)
* [not done yet, please do not enable] Optional team feature config `sndFactorPasswordChallenge` added to galley.yaml.
  The feature is disabled by default. The server wide default can be changed in galley.yaml. Please refer to [/docs/reference/config-options.md#2nd-factor-password-challenge](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/develop/docs/reference/config-options.md#2nd-factor-password-challenge) (#2138)
* Prometheus: Ignore RawResponses (e.g. cannon's await responses) from metrics (#2108)
* Refactor internal handlers for Proteus conversation creation (#2125)

# [2022-02-02] (Chart Release 4.0.0)

## Release notes


* Upgrade webapp version to 2022-01-27-production.0-v0.28.29-0-42c9a1e (#2078)


## Features


* Allow brig's additionalWriteIndex to be on a different ElasticSearch cluster.
  This allows migrating to a new ElasticSearch cluster. (#2063)

* The file sharing team feature now has a server wide configurable lock status. For more information please refer to [/docs/reference/config-options.md#file-sharing](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/develop/docs/reference/config-options.md#file-sharing). (#2059)


## Internal changes


* Remove non-existing functions from module export lists (#2095)

* Rename Spar.Sem.IdP to Spar.Sem.IdPConfigStore (#2067)

* Endpoints based on `MultiVerb` can now be made to return content types not listed in the `Accept` header (#2074)

* The lock status of the file sharing team feature can be updated via the internal API (`PUT /i/teams/:tid/features/fileSharing/(un)?locked`). (#2059)

* Servantify Galley Teams API (`GET /teams/:tid` and `DELETE /teams/:tid`). (#2092)

* Add explicit export lists to all Spar.Sem modules (#2070)

* Separate some Spar.Sem utility functions into their own module (#2069)


# [2022-01-28] (Chart Release 2.125.0)

## Release notes

* Bump the webapp version. (#2082)

## Internal changes

* Additional integration testing for conversation access control. (#2057)


# [2022-01-27] (Chart Release 2.124.0)

## Release notes

* The `nginz` chart now configures nginx to only allow cross-origin requests from an explicit allow list of subdomains. By default these are:

  ```yaml
  nginz:
    nginx_conf:
      allowlisted_origins:
      - webapp
      - teams
      - account
  ```

  If you changed the names of these services, you must adjust those names in the nginz config as well. (#1630, #2073, 116988c62732)

* Backend now separates conversation access control for guests and services. The old access roles are still supported but it is encouraged to upgrade clients since mapping between the old access roles and the new access roles is not isomorphic. For more details refer to the API changes below or the Swagger docs.
  Old clients are fully supported; if new clients and old clients are mixed, to old clients, either guests of services may appear to be enable if they are not, which may lead to error messages (confusing but harmless). (#2035)

## API changes

* Endpoints that recently have accepted `access_role` in their payload will now accept `access_role_v2` as well which will take precedence over `access_role`. See Swagger docs for how values are mapped. Endpoints that recently have returned `access_role` in their payload will now additionally return the `access_role_v2` field. (#2035)

## Features

* Conversation access roles now distinguish between guests and services. (#2035)

## Bug fixes and other updates

* There is now an explicit CORS allow list for *all* endpoints. In previous releases, all subdomains were accepted, however they must now be listed explicitly. This is a **breaking change**, as now only known Javascript applications may access the backend. (#1630, #2073, 116988c62732)
* Prevent 500s when SFTs are not reachable from Backend (#2077)

## Internal changes

* Bump hsaml2 package version (#2075)
* Separate Spar.Data module into smaller Cassandra interpreters (#2064)
* Fix some HLint issues in libs/wire-api. (#2065)
* Fix broken build process of package "old-time" for some environments (#2056)
* Refresh license headers (#2062)
* Rename Spar.Sem.ScimTokenStore.GetByTeam to LookupByTeam (#2068)

## Federation changes

* Tag several federation tests cases for the M2 release (#2045)


# [2022-01-18] (Chart Release 2.122.0)

## Release notes

* This release introduces a mandatory `federationDomain` configuration setting to cargohold. Please update your `values/wire-server/values.yaml` to set `cargohold.settings.federationDomain` to the same value as the corresponding option in galley (and brig). (#1990)
* The brig server config option `setDefaultLocale` has been replaced by `setDefaultUserLocale` and `setDefaultTemplateLocale` (see docs/reference/config-options.md for details) (#2028)
* From this release onwards, the images for haskell components (brig, galley,
  cargohold, etc.) will be using Ubuntu 20.04 as the base. The images are about
  30-35 MB larger than the previous alpine based images. (#1852)
* Wire cloud operators: Make sure [#35](https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-sft/pull/35) is applied to all SFT servers before deploying. (#2030)

## API changes

* The deprecated endpoint `GET /teams` now ignores query parameters `ids`, `start` (#2027)
* Add qualified v4 endpoints for downloading and deleting assets. The upload API is still on the same path, but the asset object it returns now contains a `domain` field. (#2002)
* Remove resumable upload API (#1998)

## Features

* Allow configuring setDefaultLocale in brig using helm chart (#2025)
* If the guest links team feature is disabled guest links will be revoked. (#1976)
* Revoke guest links if feature is disabled. If the guest links team feature is disabled `get /conversations/join`, `post /conversations/:cnv/code`, and `get /conversations/:cnv/code` will return an error. (#1980)
* Specialize `setDefaultLocale` to distinguish between default user locale and default template locale if the user's locale is n/a. (#2028)

* Upgrade nixpkgs pin used to provision developement dependencies (#1852)
* Servantify Galley Teams API. (#2008, #2010, #2027)
* When sending an activation code, the blocked domains are checked before the whitelist. This only affects the wire SaaS staging environment (there is no whitelist configuration in prod, and blocked domains are not applicable to on-prem installations). (#2023)
* Add a helm chart that deploys [restund](https://docs.wire.com/understand/restund.html) (#2003)
* Publish restund helm chart (#2036)
* Improve optional field API in schema-profunctor (#1988)

# [2021-12-10] (Chart Release 2.121.0)

## Release notes

* If you have `selfDeletingMessages` configured in `galley.yaml`, add `lockStatus: unlocked`. (#1963)
* Upgrade SFTD to 2.1.19. (#1983)

## API changes

* A new endpoint is added to Brig (`put /users/:uid/email`) that allows a team owner to initiate changing/setting a user email by (re-)sending an activation email. (#1948)
* get team feature config for self deleting messages response includes lock status (#1963)
* A new public Galley endpoint was added to dis-/enable the conversation guest link feature. The feature can only be configured through the public API if the lock status is unlocked in the server config. (#1964)
* new internal endpoints for setting the lock status of self deleting messages (#1963)

## Features

* Team and server wide config for conversation guest link feature to configure feature status and lock status (#1964). If the feature is not configured on the server, the defaults will be:

  ```txt
    featureFlags:
      ...
      conversationGuestLinks:
        defaults:
          status: enabled
          lockStatus: unlocked

* Add cargohold as a new federated component (#1973)


# [2021-12-02]

## Release notes

* Breaking change to the `fake-aws-s3` (part of `fake-aws`) helm chart. We now use minio helm chart from https://charts.min.io. The options are documented [here](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/helm/minio) (#1944)

  Before running the upgrade, the operators must use `kubectl edit deployment fake-aws-s3` and explicitly set `spec.template.spec.containers[0].serviceAccount` and `spec.template.spec.containers[0].serviceAccountName` to null. (#1944)
* Upgrade team-settings version to 4.3.0-v0.28.28-a2f11cf (#1856)
* Upgrade webapp version to 2021-12-02-production.0-v0.28.29-0-ec2fa00 (#1954)

## Features

* By default install elasticsearch version 6.8.18 when using the elasticsearch-ephemeral chart (#1952)
* Use fluent-bit chart from fluent.github.io instead of deprecated charts.helm.sh. Previous fluent-bit values are not compatible with the new chart, the documentation for the new chart can be found [here](https://github.com/fluent/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/fluent-bit) (#1952)
* Use kibana chart from helm.elastic.co instead of deprecated charts.helm.sh. Previous kibana values are not compatible with the new chart, the documentation for the new chart can be found [here](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/tree/main/kibana). This also upgrades kibana to version 6.8.18. (#1952)
* Use kube-prometheus-stack instead of prometheus-operator and update grafana dashboards for compatibility and add federation endpoints to relevant queries. (#1915)

# [2021-05-26] (Chart Release 2.107.0)

## Release Notes

**Legalhold:** This release introduces a notion of "consent" to
legalhold (LH).  If you are using LH on your site, follow the
instructions in
https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/814f3ebc251965ab4492f5df4d9195f3b2e0256f/docs/reference/team/legalhold.md#whitelisting-and-implicit-consent
after the upgrade.  **Legalhold will not work as expected until you
change `galley.conf` as described!**

**SAML/SCIM:** This release introduces changes to the way `NameID` is
processed: all identifiers are stored in lower-case and qualifiers are
ignored.  No manual upgrade steps are necessary, but consult
https://docs.wire.com/how-to/single-sign-on/trouble-shooting.html#theoretical-name-clashes-in-saml-nameids
on whether you need to re-calibrate your SAML IdP / SCIM setup.
(Reason / technical details: this change is motivated by two facts:
(1) email casing is complicated, and industry best practice appears to
be to ignore case information even though that is in conflict with the
official standard documents; and (2) SCIM user provisioning does not
allow to provide SAML NameID qualifiers, and guessing them has proven
to be infeasible.  See
https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/pull/1495 for the code
changes.)

## Features
 - [SAML/SCIM] More lenient matching of user ids (#1495)
 - [Legalhold] Block and kick users in case of LH no_consent conflict (1:1 convs). (#1507, #1530)

# [2021-03-21]

## Release Notes

If you are using Wire's SCIM functionality you shouldn't skip this release. If you skip it then there's a chance of requests from SCIM clients being missed during the time window of Wire being upgraded.
This might cause sync issues between your SCIM peer and Wire's user DB.
This is due to an internal data migration job (`spar-migrate-data`) that needs to run once. If it hasn't run yet then any upgrade to this and any later release will automatically run it. After it has completed once it is safe again to upgrade Wire while receiving requests from SCIM clients.

## Release Notes

With this release, the `setCookieDomain` configuration (under `brig`/`config`.`optSettings`) no longer has any effect, and can be removed.

## Security improvements

* Authentication cookies are set to the specific DNS name of the backend server (like nginz-https.example.com), instead of a wildcard domain (like *.example.com). This is achieved by leaving the domain empty in the Set-Cookie header, but changing the code to allow clients with old cookies to continue using them until they get renewed. (#1102)

# 2020-07-29

## Release Notes

  1. Upgrade brig as usual
  1. [Run data migration](./docs/reference/elastic-search.md#migrate-data)
  Search should continue to work normally during this upgrade.
