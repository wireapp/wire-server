-- NOTE:
-- - these packages are not provided by nix, reason being, that
--   there is a bug in the nixpkgs haskell compatibility which
--   makes it such that they cannot be installed by the nixpkgs code
-- - these packages have bounds that are justified with their current
--   dependency set, however, we have updated their dependencies, such
--   that they work with newer base and ghc (api) versions
