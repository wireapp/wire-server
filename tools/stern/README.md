Stern - Backoffice Facade
=========================

This is a simple web app based on [swagger-ui](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) for performing operations on users and teams such as browsing their user profiles, suspending, or deleting accounts. It is used internally at Wire by our customer support team.

Stern is based on a swagger interface that accesses multiple other services (mostly using internal endpoints) and is designed to be a simple way to create a basic backoffice functionality. Point your browser at <http://localhost:8091>.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

If you want to deploy this together with the rest of the wire-server services, do _NOT_ expose this to the public internet; this will give anyone with access to it a way to look into users' metadata and other potentially sensitive information.

It is intended to be deployed in a private network and accessible only through a VPN (for instance).

Some endpoints (marked as such on the Swagger interface) depend on internal services (named galeb and ibis) that are not relevant for a generic wire server installation as they gather info from other internal systems at Wire (related to billing or other services) and as such will not work properly on installations without them.
