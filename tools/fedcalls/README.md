our swaggger docs contain information about which end-points call
which federation end-points internally.  this command line tool
extracts that information from the swagger json and converts it into
two files: dot (for feeding into graphviz), and csv.

### try it out

```
cabal run fedcalls
ls wire-fedcalls.*  # these names are hard-coded (sorry!)
dot -Tpng wire-fedcalls.dot > wire-fedcalls.png
```

`dot` layouts only work for small data sets (at least without tweaking).  for a better one paste into [sketchvis](https://sketchviz.com/new).

### swagger-ui

you can get the same data for the public API in the swagger-ui output.  just load the page, open your javascript console, and type:

```
window.ui.getConfigs().showExtensions = true
```

then drop down on things like normal, and you'll see federated calls.
