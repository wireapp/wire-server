USAGE="
USAGE: $0 BASE_COMMIT TARGET_COMMIT

    BASE_COMMIT:
        A commit that contains the changes to formatting version and
        config already from TARGET_COMMIT, but not the automatically
        applied formatting changes.  Must be the first commit on the
        branch you are about to rebase (not the one returned by
        git-merge-base). It will be removed from the resulting branch.
    TARGET_COMMIT:
        The commit introducing the formatting that you want to rebase onto.

Rebase a branch onto changes created by an automated formatter. The script
will keep the (linear) history of the branch intact and make the commits appear
as if the changes had been applied onto the newly-formatted version all along.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Make a copy of your branch (or be prepared to salvage it from reflog).
   $ git branch mybranch-backup
2. Find out what the base commit is.
3. Rebase onto the base commit yourself.
   $ git rebase \$BASE_COMMIT
4. Make sure the formatting tool is installed with the correct version and settings.
   $ stack install ormolu
5. Run this script.
   $ $0 \$BASE_COMMIT \$TARGET_COMMIT

# The general idea is the following:
#
# We have a branch consisting of commits C1, C2, ... on top of our BASE_COMMIT C0.
# Also, from C0 an automated formatting change f was made on some branch (e.g. develop).
#
#  C0 ----> C1 ----> C2 ----> ... ----> Cn
#  |
#  f
#  |
#  v
#  C0'
#
# Now, how do we obtain versions of our commits operating on the formatted code (let's call them Ci')?
#
#  C0 ----> C1 ----> C2 ----> ... ----> Cn
#  |
#  f
#  |
#  v
#  C0' ---> C1' ---> C2' ---> ... ----> Cn'
#
# One useful thing is that since f is defined by an automated tool,
# we know f applied at every commit Ci, resulting in a hypothetical Ci'.
#
#  C0 ----> C1 ----> C2 ----> ... ----> Cn
#  |        |        |                  |
#  f        f        f                  f
#  |        |        |                  |
#  v        v        v                  v
#  C0'      C1'      C2'                Cn'
#
# And we can also get its inverse g (applied at Ci') by reverting the commit.
#
#  C0 ----> C1 ----> C2 ----> ... ----> Cn
#  |^       |^       |^                 |^
#  f|       f|       f|                 f|
#  |g       |g       |g                 |g
#  v|       v|       v|                 v|
#  C0'      C1'      C2'                Cn'
#
# Finally, we can get from C(i-1)' to Ci' by composing three arrows:
# - g at C(i-1)
# - Ci
# - f at C1
#
#  C0 ----> C1 ----> C2 ----> ... ----> Cn
#  |^       |^       |^                 |^
#  f|       f|       f|                 f|
#  |g       |g       |g                 |g
#  v|       v|       v|                 v|
#  C0' ---> C1' ---> C2' ---> ... ----> Cn'

# Ci=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1); git reset --soft HEAD~3; git commit --reuse-message $Ci
# We do an interactive rebase, but instead of editing the commit sequence manually,
# we use sed for that, inserting an `exec` command after every 3 commits.
