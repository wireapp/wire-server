## Wire server

This repository contains the source code for the Wire server. It contains all libraries and services necessary to run Wire.

Documentation on how to self host your own Wire-Server is not yet available but is planned. Federation is on our long term roadmap.

See more in "[Open sourcing Wire server code](https://medium.com/@wireapp/open-sourcing-wire-server-code-ef7866a731d5)".

## Architecture Overview

The following diagram gives a high-level outline of the (deployment) architecture
of the components that make up a Wire Server as well as the main internal and
external dependencies between components.

![wire-arch](doc/arch/wire-arch-2.png)

Communication between internal components is currently not guarded by
dedicated authentication or encryption and is assumed to be confined to a
private network.

## Development setup

### How to build `wire-server` binaries

There are two options:

#### 1. Compile sources natively.

This requires a range of dependencies that depend on your platform/OS, such as:

- Haskell & Rust compiler and package managers
- Some package dependencies (libsodium, openssl, protobuf, icu, geoip, snappy, [cryptobox-c](https://github.com/wireapp/cryptobox-c), ...) that depend on your platform/OS

See [doc/Dependencies.md](doc/Dependencies.md) for details.

Once all dependencies are set up, the following should succeed:

```bash
# build all haskell services
make
# build one haskell service, e.g. brig:
cd services/brig && make
```

For building nginz, see [services/nginz/README.md](services/nginz/README.md)

#### 2. Use docker

*If you don't wish to build all docker images from scratch (e.g. the `alpine-builder` takes a very long time), ready-built images can be downloaded from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/wireserver/).*

If you wish to build your own docker images, you need [docker version >= 17.05](https://www.docker.com/) and [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). Then,

```bash
make docker-services
```

will, eventually, have built a range of docker images. See the `Makefile`s and `Dockerfile`s, as well as [build/alpine/README.md](build/alpine/README.md) for details.

## How to run integration tests

Integration tests require all of the haskell services (brig,galley,cannon,gundeck,proxy,cargohold) to be correctly configured and running, before being able to execute e.g. the `brig-integration` binary. This requires most of the deployment dependencies as seen in the architecture diagram to also be available:

- Required internal dependencies:
    - cassandra (with the correct schema)
    - elasticsearch (with the correct schema)
    - redis
- Required external dependencies are the following configured AWS services (or "fake" replacements providing the same API):
    - SES
    - SQS
    - SNS
    - S3
    - Cloudfront
    - DynamoDB

Setting up these real, but in-memory internal and "fake" external dependencies is done easiest using [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Run the following in a separate terminal (it will block that terminal, C-c to shut all these docker images down again):

```
cd deploy/docker-ephemeral && docker-compose up
```

Then, to run all integration tests:

```bash
make integration
```

Or, alternatively, `make` on the top-level directory (to produce all the service's binaries) followed by e.g `cd services/brig && make integration` to run one service's integration tests only.

## How to run `wire-server` with "fake" external dependencies

See [this README](deploy/services-demo/README.md)

## How to run `wire-server` with real AWS services

Documentation, configuration, and code for this is **not fully ready yet** (please do not open an issue to ask about this!). More information on how to run `wire-server` will be available here in the near future.

As a brief overview, it requires setting up

* database clusters (cassandra, redis, elasticsearch)
* external dependencies
    * Amazon account with access to
      * SES
      * SQS
      * SNS
      * S3
      * Cloudfront
      * DynamoDB
    * Nexmo/Twilio accounts (if you want to send out SMSes)
    * Giphy/Google/Spotify/Soundcloud API keys (if you want to support previews by proxying these services)
    * TURN servers (if you want to support Voice/Video calls)
* production-ready configuration for all services
* additional infrastructure configuration (DNS, SSL certificates, metrics, logging, etc)
