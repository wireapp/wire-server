## Wire server

This repository contains the source code for the Wire server. It contains all libraries and services necessary to run Wire.

For documentation on how to self host your own Wire-Server see [this section](#how-to-install-and-run-wire-server). Federation is on our long term roadmap.

See more in "[Open sourcing Wire server code](https://medium.com/@wireapp/open-sourcing-wire-server-code-ef7866a731d5)".

## Architecture Overview

The following diagram gives a high-level outline of the (deployment) architecture
of the components that make up a Wire Server as well as the main internal and
external dependencies between components.

![wire-arch](docs/developer/architecture/wire-arch-2.png)

Communication between internal components is currently not guarded by
dedicated authentication or encryption and is assumed to be confined to a
private network.

## Development setup

### How to build `wire-server` binaries

There are two options:

#### 1. Use docker

*If you don't wish to build all docker images from scratch (e.g. the `ubuntu20-builder` takes a very long time), ready-built images can be downloaded from [here](https://quay.io/organization/wire).*

If you wish to build your own docker images, you need [docker version >= 17.05](https://www.docker.com/) and [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). Then,

```bash
# optionally:
# make docker-builder # if you don't run this, it pulls the ubuntu20-builder image from quay.io
make docker-deps docker-intermediate docker-services

# subsequent times, after changing code, if you wish to re-create docker images, it's sufficient to
make docker-intermediate docker-services
```

will, eventually, have built a range of docker images. Make sure to [give Docker enough RAM](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/issues/562); if you see `make: *** [builder] Error 137`, it might be a sign that the build ran out of memory. You can also mix and match – e.g. pull the [`ubuntu20-builder`](https://quay.io/repository/wire/ubuntu20-builder?tab=tags) image and build the rest locally.

See the `Makefile`s and `Dockerfile`s, as well as [build/ubuntu/README.md](build/ubuntu/README.md) for details.

#### 2. Use nix-provided build environment 

This is suitable only for local development and testing. See [build instructions](./docs/src/developer/developer/building.md) in the developer documentation.

## How to install and run `wire-server`

You have two options:

* Option 1. (recommended) Install wire-server on kubernetes using the configuration and instructions provided in [wire-server-deploy](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server-deploy). This is the best option to run it on a server and recommended if you want to self-host wire-server.
* Option 2. Compile everything in this repo, then you can use the [docker-compose based demo](deploy/services-demo/README.md). This option is intended as a way to try out wire-server on your local development machine and is less suited when you want to install wire-server on a server.
