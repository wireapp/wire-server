# Config Options

Reference: {#RefConfigOptions}

Fragment.

This page is about the yaml files that determine the configuration of
the Wire backend services.

## Settings in galley

```
# [galley.yaml]
settings:
  enableIndexedBillingTeamMembers: false
```

### Indexed Billing Team Members

Use indexed billing team members for journaling. When `enabled`,
galley would use the `billing_team_member` table to send billing
events with user ids of team owners (who have the `SetBilling`
permission). Before enabling this flag, the `billing_team_member`
table must be backfilled.

Even when the flag is `disabled`, galley will keep writing to the
`biling_team_member` table, this flag only affects the reads and has
been added in order to deploy new code and backfill data in
production.

### MLS private key paths

Note: This developer documentation. Documentation for site operators can be found here: {ref}`mls-message-layer-security`

The `mlsPrivateKeyPaths` field should contain a mapping from *purposes* and
signature schemes to file paths of corresponding x509 private keys in PEM
format.

At the moment, the only purpose is `removal`, meaning that the key will be used
to sign external remove proposals.

For example:

```
  mlsPrivateKeyPaths:
    removal:
      ed25519: /etc/secrets/ed25519.pem
```

A simple way to generate an ed25519 private key, discarding the corresponding
certificate, is to run the following command:

```
openssl req -nodes -newkey ed25519 -keyout ed25519.pem -out /dev/null -subj /
```

## Feature flags

> Also see [Wire docs](https://docs.wire.com/how-to/install/team-feature-settings.html) where some of the feature flags are documented from an operations point of view.

Feature flags can be used to turn features on or off, or determine the
behavior of the features. Example:

```
# [galley.yaml]
settings:
  featureFlags:
    sso: disabled-by-default
    legalhold: disabled-by-default
    teamSearchVisibility: disabled-by-default
    setEmailVisibility: visible_to_self
```

The `featureFlags` field in the galley settings is mandatory, and all
features must be listed.  Each feature defines its own set of allowed
flag values.  (The reason for that is that as we will see, the
semantics is slightly different (or more specific) than boolean.)

### SSO

This sets the default setting for all teams, and can be overridden by
customer support / backoffice.  [Allowed
values](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/46713382a1a6544de3936eb03e987b9f76df3faa/libs/galley-types/src/Galley/Types/Teams.hs#L327-L329):
`disabled-by-default`, `enabled-by-default`.

IMPORTANT: if you change this from 'enabled-by-default' to
'disabled-by-default' in production, you need to run [this migration
script](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/tree/master/tools/db/migrate-sso-feature-flag)
to fix all teams that have registered an idp.  (if you don't, the idp
will keep working, but the admin won't be able to register new idps.)

### LegalHold

Optionally block customer support / backoffice from enabling legal
hold for individual teams.  [Allowed
values](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/46713382a1a6544de3936eb03e987b9f76df3faa/libs/galley-types/src/Galley/Types/Teams.hs#L332-L334):
'disabled-permanently', 'disabled-by-default'.

IMPORTANT: If you switch this back to `disabled-permanently` from
`disabled-by-default`, LegalHold devices may still be active in teams
that have created them while it was allowed.  This may change in the
future.

### Expose invitation URLs to team admin

For further processing (e.g. sending custom emails or rendering the URLs as QR
codes), team invitation URLs can be made part of the result of
`GET /teams/{tid}/invitations`.

```json
{
    "has_more": false,
    "invitations": [
        {
            "created_at": "2022-09-15T15:47:28.577Z",
            "created_by": "375f56fe-7f12-4c0c-aed8-d48c0326d1fb",
            "email": "foo@example.com",
            "id": "4decf7f8-bdd4-43b3-aaf2-e912e2c0c46f",
            "name": null,
            "phone": null,
            "role": "member",
            "team": "51612209-3b61-49b0-8c55-d21ae65efc1a",
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/register?team=51612209-3b61-49b0-8c55-d21ae65efc1a&team_code=RpxGkK_yjw8ZBegJuFQO0hha-2Tneajp"
        }
    ]
}
```

This can be a privacy issue as it allows the team admin to impersonate as
another team member. The feature is disabled by default.

To activate this feature two steps are needed. First, the team id (tid) has to
be added to the list of teams for which this feature *can* be enabled
(`exposeInvitationURLsTeamAllowlist`). This is done in `galley`'s `values.yaml`:

```yaml
settings:
  exposeInvitationURLsTeamAllowlist: ["51612209-3b61-49b0-8c55-d21ae65efc1a", ...]
```

Then, the feature can be set for the team by enabling the
`exposeInvitationURLsToTeamAdmin` flag. This is done by making a `PUT` request
to `/teams/{tid}/features/exposeInvitationURLsToTeamAdmin` with the body:

```json
{
    "status": "enabled"
}
```

### Team searchVisibility

The team flag `searchVisibility` affects the outbound search of user
searches. If it is set to `no-name-outside-team` for a team then all users of
that team will no longer be able to find users that are not part of their team
when searching. This also includes finding other users by by providing their
exact handle. By default it is set to `standard`, which doesn't put any
additional restrictions to outbound searches.

The setting can be changed via endpoint:

```
GET /teams/{tid}/search-visibility
  -- Shows the current TeamSearchVisibility value for the given team

PUT /teams/{tid}/search-visibility
  -- Set specific search visibility for the team

pull-down-menu "body":
  "standard"
  "no-name-outside-team"
```

The team feature flag `teamSearchVisibility` determines whether it is allowed to change the `searchVisibility` setting or not.
The default is `disabled-by-default`. Note that whenever this feature setting is disabled the `searchVisibility` will be reset to `standard`.

The default setting that applies to all teams on the instance can be defined at configuration

```yaml
settings:
  featureFlags:
    teamSearchVisibility: disabled-by-default # or enabled-by-default
```

### TeamFeature searchVisibilityInbound

The team feature flag `searchVisibilityInbound` affects if the team's users are
searchable by users from _other_ teams. The default setting is
`searchable-by-own-team` which hides users from search results by users from
other teams. If it is set to `searchable-by-all-teams` then users of this team
may be included in the results of search queries by other users.

Note: The configuration of this flag does _not_ affect search results when the
search query matches the handle exactly. If the handle is provdided then any user on the instance can find users.

This team feature flag can only by toggled by site-administrators with direct access to the galley instance:

```
PUT /i/teams/{tid}/features/search-visibility-inbound
with JSON body {"status": "enabled"} or body {"status": disabled}
```

where `enabled` is equivalent to `searchable-by-all-teams` and disabled is equivalent to `searchable-by-own-team`.

The default setting that applies to all teams on the instance can be defined at configuration.

```yaml
searchVisibilityInbound:
  defaults:
    status: enabled # OR disabled
```

Individual teams can overwrite the default setting.

### Email Visibility

[Allowd values](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/0126651a25aabc0c5589edc2b1988bb06550a03a/services/brig/src/Brig/Options.hs#L304-L306) and their [description](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/0126651a25aabc0c5589edc2b1988bb06550a03a/services/brig/src/Brig/Options.hs#L290-L299).

### Classified domains

To enable classified domains, the following needs to be in galley.yaml or wire-server/values.yaml under `settings` / `featureFlags`:

```yaml
classifiedDomains:
  status: enabled
  config:
    domains: ["example.com", "example2.com"]
```

Note that when enabling this feature, it is important to provide your own domain
too in the list of domains. In the example above, `example.com` or `example2.com` is your domain.

To disable, either omit the entry entirely (it is disabled by default), or provide the following:

```yaml
classifiedDomains:
  status: disabled
  config:
    domains: []
```

### Conference Calling

The `conferenceCalling` feature flag controls whether a user can initiate a conference call. The flag can be toggled between its states `enabled` and `disabled` per team via an internal endpoint.

The `conferenceCalling` section in `featureFlags` defines the state of the `conferenceCalling` feature flag for all personal users (users that don't belong to a team). For personal users there is no way to toggle the flag, so the setting of the config section wholly defines the state of `conferenceCalling` flag for all personal users.

The `conferenceCalling` section in `featureFlags` also defines the _initial_ state of the `conferenceCalling` flag for all teams. After the flag is set for the first time for a team via the internal endpoint the value from the config section will be ignored.

Example value for the config section:
```yaml
conferenceCalling:
  defaults:
    status: enabled
```

The `conferenceCalling` section is optional in `featureFlags`. If it is omitted then it is assumed to be `enabled`.

See also: conference falling for personal accounts (below).

### File Sharing

File sharing is enabled and unlocked by default. If you want a different configuration, use the following syntax:

```yaml
fileSharing:
  defaults:
    status: disabled|enabled
    lockStatus: locked|unlocked
```

These are all the possible combinations of `status` and `lockStatus`:

| `status`   | `lockStatus` |                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`  | `locked`     | Feature enabled, cannot be disabled by team admin |
| `enabled`  | `unlocked`   | Feature enabled, can be disabled by team admin    |
| `disabled` | `locked`     | Feature disabled, cannot be enabled by team admin |
| `disabled` | `unlocked`   | Feature disabled, can be enabled by team admin    |

The lock status for individual teams can be changed via the internal API (`PUT /i/teams/:tid/features/fileSharing/(un)?locked`).

The feature status for individual teams can be changed via the public API (if the feature is unlocked).

### Validate SAML Emails

If this is enabled, if a new user account is created with an email address as SAML NameID or SCIM externalId, users will receive a validation email.  If they follow the validation procedure, they will be able to receive emails about their account, eg., if a new device is associated with the account.  If the user does not validate their email address, they can still use it to login.

Validate SAML emails is enabled by default; this is almost always what you want. If you want a different configuration, use the following syntax:

```yaml
# galley.yaml
validateSAMLEmails:
  defaults:
    status: disabled
```

### 2nd Factor Password Challenge

By default Wire enforces a 2nd factor authentication for certain user operations like e.g. activating an account, changing email or password, or deleting an account.
If this feature is enabled, a 2nd factor password challenge will be performed for a set of additional user operations like e.g. for generating SCIM tokens, login, or adding a client.

Usually the default is what you want. If you explicitly want to enable the feature, use the following syntax:

```yaml
# galley.yaml
sndFactorPasswordChallenge:
  defaults:
    status: disabled|enabled
    lockStatus: locked|unlocked
```

### MLS

This feature specifies how should behave. It has no effect on the server's behaviour.

If this feature is enabled then clients that support this feature will allowing its user to switch between Proteus and the MLS protocol provided the user is listed ini `protocolToggleUsers`. The default protocol that clients will create new conversations with is specified in `defaultProtocol`. The `defaultCipherSuite` and `allowedCipherSuites` contain the default ciphersuite and the allowed ciphersuites that clients should be using. The numerical values should correspond to the indices (starting at 1) specified here https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html#table-5

If this feature is disabled then clients will use the Proteus protocol with this backend.

The default configuration that applies to all teams that didn't explicitly change their feature configuration can be given in galley's `featureFlags` section in the config file:

```
# galley.yaml
mls:
  defaults:
    status: disabled
    config:
      protocolToggleUsers: []
      defaultProtocol: proteus
      allowedCipherSuites: [1]
      defaultCipherSuite: 1

```

This default configuration can be overriden on a per-team basis through the [feature config API](../developer/features.md)


### Federation Domain

Regardless of whether a backend wants to enable federation or not, the operator
must decide what its domain is going to be. This helps in keeping things
simpler across all components of Wire and also enables to turn on federation in
the future if required.

For production uses, it is highly recommended that this domain be configured as
something that is controlled by the operator(s). The backend or frontend do not
need to be available on this domain. As per our current federation design, you
must be able to set an SRV record for `_wire-server-federator._tcp.<domain>`.
This record should have entries which lead to the federator.

**IMPORTANT** Once this option is set, it cannot be changed without breaking
experience for all the users which are already using the backend.

This configuration needs to be made in brig, cargohold and galley (note the
slighly different spelling of the config options).

```yaml
# brig.yaml
optSettings:
  setFederationDomain: example.com
```

```yaml
# cargohold.yaml
settings:
  federationDomain: example.com
```

```yaml
# galley.yaml
settings:
  federationDomain: example.com
```

### Federation allow list

As of 2021-07, federation (whatever is implemented by the time you read this) is turned off by default by means of having an empty allow list:

```yaml
# federator.yaml
optSettings:
  federationStrategy:
    allowedDomains: []
```

You can choose to federate with a specific list of allowed servers:


```yaml
# federator.yaml
optSettings:
  federationStrategy:
    allowedDomains:
      - server1.example.com
      - server2.example.com
```

or, you can federate with everyone:

```yaml
# federator.yaml
optSettings:
  federationStrategy:
    # note the 'empty' value after 'allowAll'
    allowAll:

# when configuring helm charts, this becomes (note 'true' after 'allowAll')
# inside helm_vars/wire-server:
federator:
  optSettings:
    federationStrategy:
      allowAll: true
```

### Federation TLS Config

When a federator connects with another federator, it does so over HTTPS. There
are a few options to configure the CA for this:
1. `useSystemCAStore`: Boolean. If set to `True` it will use the system CA.
2. `remoteCAStore`: Maybe Filepath. This config option can be used to specify
   multiple certificates from either a single file (multiple PEM formatted
   certificates concatenated) or directory (one certificate per file, file names
   are hashes from certificate).
3. `clientCertificate`: Maybe Filepath. A client certificate to use when
   connecting to remote federators. If this option is omitted, no client
   certificate is used. If it is provided, then the `clientPrivateKey` option
   (see below) must be provided as well.
4. `clientPrivateKey`: Maybe Filepath. The private key corresponding to the
   `clientCertificate` option above. It is an error to provide only a private key
   without the corresponding certificate.

Both the `useSystemCAStore` and `remoteCAStore` options can be specified, in
which case the stores are concatenated and used for verifying certificates.
When `useSystemCAStore` is set to `false` and `remoteCAStore` is not provided,
all outbound connections will fail with a TLS error as there will be no CA for
verifying the server certificate.

#### Examples

Federate with anyone, no client certificates, use system CA store to verify
server certificates:

```yaml
federator:
  optSettings:
    federationStrategy:
      allowAll:
    useSystemCAStore: true
```

Federate only with `server2.example.com`, use a client certificate and a
specific CA:

```yaml
federator:
  optSettings:
    federationStrategy:
      allowedDomains:
        - server2.example.com
    useSystemCAStore: false
    clientCertificate: client.pem
    clientPrivateKey: client-key.pem
```

## Outlook calalendar integration

This feature setting only applies to the Outlook Calendar extension for Wire. As it is an external service, it should only be configured through this feature flag and otherwise ignored by the backend.

Example default configuration:

```yaml
# galley.yaml
outlookCalIntegration:
  defaults:
    status: disabled
    lockStatus: locked
```

## Settings in brig

Some features (as of the time of writing this: only
`conferenceCalling`) allow to set defaults for personal accounts in
brig. Those are taken into account in galley's end-points `GET
/feature-configs*`.

To be specific:

### Conference Calling

Two values can be configured for personal accounts: a default for when
the user record contains `null` as feature config, and default that
should be inserted into the user record when creating new users:

```
# [brig.yaml]
settings:
  setFeatureFlags:
    conferenceCalling:
      defaultForNew:
        status: disabled
      defaultForNull:
        status: enabled
```

You can omit the entire `conferenceCalling` block, but not parts of
it.  Built-in defaults: `defaultForNew: null` (user record attribute
is left empty); `defaultForNull: enabled`.  This maintains behavior
prior to the introduction of this change, while allowing site owners
to postpone the decision about the default setting.

When new users are created, their config will be initialized with
what's in `defaultForNew`.

When a `null` value is encountered, it is assumed to be
`defaultForNull`.

(Introduced in https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/pull/1811.)

### SFT configuration

Configuring SFT load balancing can be done in two (mutually exclusive) settings:

1) Configuring a SRV DNS record based load balancing setting

```
# [brig.yaml]
sft:
  sftBaseDomain: sft.wire.example.com
  sftSRVServiceName: sft
  sftDiscoveryIntervalSeconds: 10
  sftListLength: 20
```

or

2) Configuring a HTTP-based load balancing setting

```
# [brig.yaml]
settings:
  setSftStaticUrl: https://sft.wire.example.com
```

This setting assumes that the sft load balancer has been deployed with the `sftd` helm chart.

Additionally if `setSftListAllServers` is set to `enabled` (disabled by default) then the `/calls/config/v2` endpoint will include a list of all servers that are load balanced by `setSftStaticUrl` at field `sft_servers_all`. This is required to enable calls between federated instances of Wire.

### Locale


#### setDefaultLocale (deprecated / ignored)

The brig server config option `setDefaultLocale` has been replaced by `setDefaultUserLocale` and `setDefaultTemplateLocale`. Both settings are optional and `setDefaultTemplateLocale` defaults to `EN` and `setDefaultLocale` defaults to `setDefaultTemplateLocale`. If `setDefaultLocale` was not set or set to `EN` before this change, nothing needs to be done. If `setDefaultLocale` was set to any other language other than `EN` the name of the setting should be changed to `setDefaultTemplateLocale`.

#### `setDefaultTemplateLocale`

This option determines the default locale for email templates. The language of the email communication is determined by the user locale (see above). Only if templates of the the locale of the user do not exist or if user locale is not set the `setDefaultTemplateLocale` is used as a fallback. If not set the default is `EN`. This setting should not be changed unless a complete set of templates is available for the given language.

```
# [brig.yaml]
optSettings:
  setDefaultTemplateLocale: en
```

#### `setDefaultUserLocale`

This option determines which language to use for email communication. It is the default value if none is given in the user profile, or if no user profile exists (eg., if user is being provisioned via SCIM or manual team invitation via the team management app). If not set, `setDefaultTemplateLocale` is used instead.

```
# [brig.yaml]
optSettings:
  setDefaultUserLocale: en
```

### MLS settings

#### `setEnableMLS`

This option determines whether MLS is supported on this backend. When set to false (or absent), MLS endpoints will fail without performing any action.

#### `setKeyPackageMaximumLifetime`

This option specifies the maximum accepted lifetime of a key package from the moment it is uploaded, in seconds. For example, when brig is configured as follows:

```
# [brig.yaml]
optSettings:
  setKeyPackageMaximumLifetime: 1296000 # 15 days
```

any key package whose expiry date is set further than 15 days after upload time will be rejected.


### Federated domain specific configuration settings
#### Restrict user search

The lookup and search of users on a wire instance can be configured. This can be done per federated domain.

```yaml
# [brig.yaml]
optSettings:
  setFederationDomainConfigs:
    - domain: example.com
      search_policy: no_search
```

Valid values for `search_policy` are:
- `no_search`: No users are returned by federated searches.
- `exact_handle_search`: Only users where the handle exactly matches are returned.
- `full_search`: Additionally to `exact_handle_search`, users are found by a freetext search on handle and display name.

If there is no configuration for a domain, it's defaulted to `no_search`.

### API Versioning

#### `setEnableDevelopmentVersions`

This options determines whether development versions should be enabled. If set to `False`, all development versions are removed from the `supported` field of the `/api-version` endpoint. Note that they are still listed in the `development` field, and continue to work normally.

#### Disabling API versions

It is possible to disable one ore more API versions. When an API version is disabled it won't be advertised on the `GET /api-version` endpoint, neither in the `supported`, nor in the `development` section. Requests made to any endpoint of a disabled API version will result in the same error response as a request made to an API version that does not exist.

Each of the services brig, cannon, cargohold, galley, gundeck, proxy, spar should to be configured with the same set of disable API versions in each service's values.yaml config files. 


For example to disable API version v3, you need to configure:

```
# brig's values.yaml
config.optSettings.setDisabledAPIVersions: [ 3 ]

# cannon's values.yaml
config.disabledAPIVersions: [ 3 ]

# cargohold's values.yaml
config.settings.disabledAPIVersions: [ 3 ]

# galley's values.yaml
config.settings.disabledAPIVersions: [ 3 ]

# gundecks' values.yaml
config.disabledAPIVersions: [ 3 ]

# proxy's values.yaml
config.disabledAPIVersions: [ 3 ]

# spar's values.yaml
config.disabledAPIVersions: [ 3 ]
```

The default setting is that no API version is disabled.
