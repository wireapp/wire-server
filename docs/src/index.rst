Welcome to Wire's (self-hosting) documentation!
===============================================

The targeted audience of this documentation is:

* people wanting to understand how the server components of Wire work
* people wishing to self-host Wire on their own datacentres or cloud

This documentation may be expanded in the future to cover other aspects of Wire.
