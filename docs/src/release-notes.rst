Release notes
-------------

This page previously contained the release notes for the project, and they were manually updated each time a new release was done, due to limitations in Github's «releases» feature.

However, Github since updated the feature, making this page un-necessary. 

Go to → `GitHub - wireapp/wire-server: Wire back-end services <https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/>`_

→ Look at releases on right hand side. They are shown by date of release. `Release Notes <https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases>`_

→ Open the CHANGELOG.md. This will give you chart version.
