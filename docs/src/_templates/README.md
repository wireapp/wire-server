# Writing HTML templates

If you want more control over HTML generation over ReadTheDocs theme. See https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/tree/master/sphinx_rtd_theme for specific templates you may wish to override. It can be fully overriden or partially (just extend the default template and only use the block you wish to change).
