.. note::

    If you use ssh *keys*, and the user you login with is either `root` or can elevate to `root` without a password, you don't need to do anything further to use ansible. If, however, you use password authentication for ssh access, and/or your login user needs a password to become root, see :ref:`ansible-authentication`.
