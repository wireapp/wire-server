.. _configure-federation:

Configure Wire-Server for federation
=====================================

Background
-----------

Please first understand the current scope and aim of wire-server federation by reading :ref:`Understanding federation <federation-understand>`.

.. warning:: As of June 2022, federation implementation is still work in progress. Many features are not implemented yet,
    and it should be considered "beta": stability, and upgrade compatibility are not guaranteed.

Summary of necessary steps to configure federation
--------------------------------------------------

The steps needed to configure federation are as follows and they will be detailed in the sections below:

* Choose a backend domain name
* DNS setup for federation (including an ``SRV`` record)
* Generate and configure TLS certificates:

    * server certificates
    * client certificates
    * a selection of CA certificates you trust when interacting with other backends

* Configure helm charts : federator, brig, galley, cargohold, ingress and webapp subcharts
* Test that your configurations work as expected.

.. _choose-backend-domain:

Choose a :ref:`Backend Domain Name<glossary_backend_domain>`
------------------------------------------------------------

A Backend Domain (set as ``federationDomain`` or ``setFederationDomain`` in
configuration) is a mandatory configuration setting. Regardless of whether you
want to enable federation for a backend or not, you must decide what its domain
is going to be. This helps in keeping things simpler across all components of
Wire and also enables to turn on federation in the future if required.

It is highly recommended that this domain is controlled by the
administrators/operators. The actual servers do not need to be available on this
domain, but one MUST be able to set an SRV record for
``_wire-server-federator._tcp.<Backend Domain>`` that informs other wire-server
backends where to find your actual servers.

**IMPORTANT**: Once this option is set, it cannot be changed without breaking
experience for all the users which are already using the backend.

.. _consequences-backend-domain:

Consequences of the choice of Backend Domain
--------------------------------------------

* You need control over a specific subdomain of this Backend Domain (to set an
  SRV DNS record as explained in the next section). Without this control, you cannot federate with anyone.

* This Backend Domain becomes part of the underlying identity of all users on
  your servers.

   * Example: Let's say you choose ``example.com`` as your Backend Domain.
     Your user known to you as Alice, and known on your server with ID
     ``ac41a202-2555-11ec-9341-00163e5e6c00`` will become known for other
     servers you federate with as

     .. code:: json

        {
          "user": {
            "id": "ac41a202-2555-11ec-9341-00163e5e6c00",
            "domain": "example.com"
          }
        }

* This domain is used in the User Interface alongside user information.

   * Example: Using the same example as above, for backends you federate with, Alice
     would be displayed with the human-readable username ``@alice@example.com``
     for users on other backends.

.. warning ::

    *Changing* this Backend Domain after existing user activity with a recent
    version (versions later than ~May/June 2021) will lead to undefined
    behaviour (untested, not accounted for during development) on some or all
    client platforms (Web, Android, iOS) for those users: It is possible your
    clients could crash, or lose part of their data about themselves or other
    users and conversations, or otherwise exhibit unexpected behaviour. If at
    all possible, do not change this backend domain. We do not intend to provide
    support if you change the backend domain.


.. _dns-configure-federation:

.. include:: ./includes/dns-federation.rst

Generate and configure TLS server and client certificates
---------------------------------------------------------

Are your servers on the public internet? Then you have the option of using TLS certificates from `Let's encrypt
<https://letsencrypt.org/>`__. In such a case go to subsection (A). If your servers are not on the public internet
or you would like to use your own CA, go to subsection (B).

.. note::

   As of Jan 2022, we're using the `hs-tls <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tls>` library for outgoing TLS connections to other backends, which only supports P256 for ECDSA keys.
   Therefore, we have specified a `key size of 256 bits <https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/blob/096c48c1f9b6b01572c737bd296dddd7cb5ddabb/charts/nginx-ingress-services/templates/certificate_federator.yaml>`__ with the use of let's encrypt (section A below, you don't need to do anything further). The key size will be visible when inspecting your certificate as a block looking similar to the following::

      Subject Public Key Info:
       Public Key Algorithm: id-ecPublicKey
           Public-Key: (256 bit)
           ASN1 OID: prime256v1
           NIST CURVE: P-256

   or::

      Subject Public Key Info:
       Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
            RSA Public-Key: (2048 bit)

   If you create your own certificates, and use ECDSA as the algorithm, please ensure you configure a key size of 256 for the time being (There are no restrictions to key sizes if you're using RSA keys, but key sizes larger than 3000 bit are recommended).


   For details on cipher configuration, see :ref:`tls`.

   Improvements to the TLS setup are planned (TLS 1.3 support; no restrictions on key sizes anymore), those are tracked internally under FS-33 and FS-49 (tickets only visible to Wire employees).


(A) Let's encrypt TLS server and client certificate generation and renewal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following will make use of `Let's encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`__ for both server certificates (used when
someone sends a request to your ``federator.<domain-name>``) and client certificates (used for making outgoing requests
to other backends).

For that, you need to have `jetstack/cert-manager <https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager>`__ installed. You can
follow the helm chart installation `here <https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/>`__.

Once you have cert-manager, adjust the email address below, then set the following in the nginx-ingress-services overrides:

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for nginx-ingress-services
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/nginx-ingress-services/values.yaml)
    tls:
      useCertManager: true

    certManager:
      inTestMode: false
      certmasterEmail: "certificates@example.com"

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for wire-server
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/wire-server/values.yaml)
    federator:
      tls:
        useSharedFederatorSecret: true

You can now skip section (B) and go to Configure CA certificates you trust when interacting with other backends.

(B) Manual server and client certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use your usual method of obtaining X.509 certificates for your :ref:`federation infra domain
<glossary_infra_domain>` (alongside the other domains needed for a wire-server installation).

You can use one single certificate and key for both server and client certificate use.

.. note::

   Currently (October 2021), due to a limitation of the TLS library in use for federation (`hs-tls
   <https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls>`__), only some ciphers are supported. Moving to an
   openssl-based library is planned, which will provide support for a wider range of ciphers.

..
    TODO: provide a list of supported ciphers and signature algorithms.

Your certificates need to have the "Server" and "Client" key usage listed among the X509 extensions:

.. code:: bash

    # inspect your certificate:
    openssl x509 -inform pem -noout -text < your-certificate.pem

.. code:: bash

    X509v3 extensions:
        X509v3 Key Usage: critical
            Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
        X509v3 Extended Key Usage:
            TLS Web Server Authentication, TLS Web Client Authentication

And your :ref:`federation infra domain <glossary_infra_domain>` (e.g. ``federator.wire.example.com``
from the running example) needs to either be figured explictly in the list of your SAN (Subject
Alternative Name):

.. code:: bash

    X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
        DNS:federator.wire.example.com, DNS:nginz-https.wire.example.com, ...

Or you need to have a wildcard certificate that includes it:

.. code:: bash

    X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: critical
        DNS:*.wire.example.com

Configure the *client certificate* and *private key* inside wire-server/federator:

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for wire-server
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/wire-server/values.yaml or helm_vars/wire-server/secrets.yaml)
    federator:
      clientCertificateContents: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        .....
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      clientPrivateKeyContents: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        .....
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

The *server certificate* and *private key* need to be configured in ``nginx-ingress-services``. Those are used for all
of the services, not just the federator component. If you have installed
wire-server before without federation, server certificates may already be configured *(though you probably need to create
new certificates to include the federation infra domain if you're not making use of wildcard certificates)*. Server
certificates go here:

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for nginx-ingress-services
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/nginx-ingress-services/secrets.yaml)
    secrets:
      tlsWildcardCert: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... <cert goes here>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

      tlsWildcardKey: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY -----
        ... <private key goes here>
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----


Configure CA certificates you trust when interacting with other backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to federate with servers at ``othercompany.example.com``, then you need to trust the CA (Certificate Authority)
certificate that ``othercompany.example.com`` has used to sign its client certificates.

They need to be set both for the nginx-ingress-services and the wire-server chart.

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for nginx-ingress-services
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/nginx-ingress-services/values.yaml)
    secrets:
      tlsClientCA: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... <CA in PEM format goes here>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... <another CA in PEM format goes here>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for wire-server
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/wire-server/values.yaml)
    federator:
      remoteCAContents: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... <CA in PEM format goes here>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... <another CA in PEM format goes here>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

Tell parties you intend to federate with about your certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The backends you want to federate with should add your (or Let's Encrypt's) CA
to their store, so you should give them your CA certificate, or tell them to use
the appropriate Let's Encrypt root certificate.

Configure helm charts: brig, galley, cargohold, federator and ingress and webapp subcharts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set your chosen backend domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Read :ref:`choose-backend-domain` again, then set the backend domain three times
to the same value in the subcharts cargohold, galley and brig. You also need to
set ``enableFederator`` to ``true``.

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for wire-server
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/wire-server/values.yaml)
    galley:
      config:
        enableFederator: true
        settings:
          federationDomain: example.com # your chosen "backend domain"

    brig:
      config:
        enableFederator: true
        optSettings:
          setFederationDomain: example.com # your chosen "backend domain"

    cargohold:
      config:
        enableFederator: true
        settings:
          federationDomain: example.com # your chosen "backend domain"

Configure the webapp to enable federation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for wire-server
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/wire-server/values.yaml)
    webapp:
      envVars:
        FEATURE_ENABLE_FEDERATION: "true"

Configure federator process to run and allow incoming traffic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For federation to work, the ``federator`` subchart of wire-server has to be enabled:

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for wire-server
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/wire-server/values.yaml)
    tags:
      federator: true

You also need to enable ingress->federator proxying and configure the charts to use the DNS you configured as a target
in :ref:`dns-configure-federation` above

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for nginx-ingress-services
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/nginx-ingress-services/values.yaml)
    federator:
      enabled: true

    config:
      dns:
        federator: federator.wire.example.org # set this to your "infra" domain

Configure the validation depth when handling client certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, ``verify_depth`` is ``1``, meaning that in order to validate an incoming request from another backend, this backend needs to have a client certificate that is directly (without any intermediate certificates) signed by a CA certificate from the trust store.

Example: If you trust a CA ``root`` which signs an intermediate ``intermediate-1`` which in turn signs ``intermediate-2`` which finally signs ``leaf``, and ``leaf`` is used during mutual TLS when validating incoming requests, then ``verify_depth`` would need to be set to ``3``.

.. code:: yaml

    # nginx-ingress-services/values.yaml
    tls:
      # the validation depth between a federator client certificate and tlsClientCA
      verify_depth: 3 # default: 1

Configure the allow list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, federation is turned off (allow list set to the empty list):

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for wire-server
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/wire-server/values.yaml)
    federator:
      config:
        optSettings:
          federationStrategy:
            allowedDomains: []

You can choose to federate with a specific list of allowed backends:

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for wire-server
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/wire-server/values.yaml)
    federator:
      config:
        optSettings:
          federationStrategy:
            allowedDomains:
             - example.com
             - example.org

Alternatively, you can federate with everyone:

.. code:: yaml

    # override values for wire-server
    # (e.g. under ./helm_vars/wire-server/values.yaml)
    federator:
      config:
        optSettings:
          federationStrategy:
            allowAll: true


Applying all configuration changes
----------------------------------

Depending on your installation method and time you initially installed your first version of wire-server, commands to
run to apply all of the above configurations may vary. You want to ensure that you upgrade the ``nginx-ingress-services``
and ``wire-server`` helm charts at a minimum.

Manually test that your configurations work as expected
-------------------------------------------------------

Manually test DNS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use ``dig`` to check for SRV records, use e.g.::

    dig +short SRV _wire-server-federator._tcp.wire.example.com

Should yield something like::

    0 10 443 federator.wire.example.com.

The actual target::

    dig +short federator.wire.example.com

should also point to an IP address::

    1.2.3.4 # of course you should get a valid IP here

Ensure that the IP matches where your backend ingress runs.

Manually test certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Refer to :ref:`how-to-see-tls-certs` and set DOMAIN to your :ref:`federation infra domain <glossary_infra_domain>`. They
should include your domain as part of the SAN (Subject Alternative Names) and not have expired.

Manually test that federation "works"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prerequisites:

* You need two backends with federation configured and enabled.
* They both need to have each other in the allow list.
* They both need to trust each other's CA certificate.

Create user accounts on both backends.

With one user, search for the other user using the ``@username-1@example.com`` syntax in the UI search field of the
webapp.

..
    FUTUREWORK
    * A way to validate overall helm configuration to be consistent
    * A way to test client certificates.
