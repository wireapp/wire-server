# Implementation Roadmap

Internally at Wire, we have divided implemention of federation into
multiple milestones. Only the milestone on which implementation has
started will be shown here (as later milestones are subject to internal
change and re-ordering)

(m1-federation-with-proteus-mvp)=

## M1 federation with proteus MVP

The first milestone **M1** is a minimum-viable-product that allows users
on different Wire backends to send textual messages to users on other
backends.

M1 included support for:

-   user search
-   creating group conversations
-   message sending
-   visual UX for showing federation.
-   a way for on-premise (self-hosted) installations of wire to try out
    this implementation of federation by explicitly enabling it via
    configuration flags.
-   Android, Web and iOS will be supported
-   server2server discovery and authentication
-   a way to specify an allow list of backends to federate with

(m2-federation-with-callingconferencing-and-assets)=

## M2 federation with calling/conferencing and assets

The second milestone **M2** focused on:

-   federated calling
-   federated conferencing
-   basic federated asset support.

**M2** also incorporated a previous interim release which added the
following in a federated environment:

-   likes
-   mentions
-   read receipts and delivery notifications
-   pings
-   edit and delete messages

Caveats:

-   Message delivery guarantees are weak if any backends are temporarily
    unavailable.
-   If any backends are unavailable, data inconsistencies may occur.
-   Federation with the production cloud version of wire.com is not yet
    supported.
-   Federated conferencing requires an SFT in each domain represented in
    the conversation. The caller\'s SFT is the \"anchor\" SFT, to which
    federated SFTs connect:
    -   SFTs must have valid certificates suitable for mutual
        authentication with federated SFTs.
    -   Currently all video streams are exchanged between the anchor SFT
        and each federated SFT. The SFTs select the relevant streams for
        each client as today, but inter-SFT traffic could use
        substantially more bandwidth than an SFT to client stream.
    -   The administrator needs to open ports between their SFTs and
        federated SFTs for signalling and media.
-   Assets will be stored on the backend of the sender and fetched via
    the sender\'s backend with every access (there is no caching on a
    federated domain). If federated domains have different policies for
    allowed asset types or sizes, a user may receive notification of an
    asset which it is not allowed to fetch or view.


```{note}
A rough (Backend) Implementation Status as of January 2022:

Tested in M2 scope:

-   Federator as Egress, and Ingress support to allow
    backend-backend communication
-   Long-running test environments
-   Backend Discovery via SRV records
-   Backend allow list support
-   User search via exact handle
-   Get user profile, user clients, and prekeys for their clients
-   Create conversation with remote users
-   Send a message in a conversation with remote users
-   Server2server authentication
-   connections
-   Assets
-   Calling
-   Conferencing

Partially done:

-   client-server API changes for federation
-   Other conversation features (removing users, archived/muted,
    \...)
```

(additional-milestones)=

## Additional Milestones

Some additional milestones planned include the following features:

-   support more features (guest users, bots, \...)
-   support better message delivery guarantees
-   federation API versioning strategy
-   support for wire-server installations to federate with wire.com
-   MLS support
