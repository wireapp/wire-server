# User Searchability

You can configure how search is limited or not based on user membership in a given team.

There are two types of searches based on the direction of search:

- **Inbound** searches mean that somebody is searching for you. Configuring the inbound search visibility means that you (or some admin) can configure whether others can find you or not.
- **Outbound** searches mean that you are searching for somebody. Configuring the outbound search visibility means that some admin can configure whether you can find other users or not.

There are different types of matches:

- **Exact handle** search means that the user is found only if the search query is exactly the user handle (e.g. searching for `mc` will find `@mc` but not `@mccaine`). This search returns zero or one results.
- **Full text** search means that the user is found if the search query contains some subset of the user display name and handle. (e.g. the query `mar` will find `Marco C`, `Omar`, `@amaro`)

## Searching users on the same backend

Search visibility is controlled by three parameters on the backend:

- A team outbound configuration flag, `TeamSearchVisibility` with possible values `SearchVisibilityStandard`, `SearchVisibilityNoNameOutsideTeam`

  - `SearchVisibilityStandard` means that the user can find other people outside of the team, if the searched-person inbound search allows it
  - `SearchVisibilityNoNameOutsideTeam` means that the user can not find any user outside the team by full text search (but exact handle search still works)

- A team inbound configuration flag, `SearchVisibilityInbound` with possible values `SearchableByOwnTeam`, `SearchableByAllTeams`

  - `SearchableByOwnTeam` means that the user can be found only by users in their own team.
  - `SearchableByAllTeams` means that the user can be found by users in any/all teams.

- A server configuration flag `searchSameTeamOnly` with possible values true, false.

  - `Note`: For the same backend, this affects inbound and outbound searches (simply because all teams will be subject to this behavior)
  - Setting this to `true` means that the all teams on that backend can only find users that belong to their team

These flag are set on the backend and the clients do not need to be aware of them.

The flags will influence the behavior of the search API endpoint; clients will only need to parse the results, that are already filtered for them by the backend.

+------------------------------------+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
```

### Changing the configuration on the server

To change the `searchSameTeamOnly` setting on the backend, edit the `values.yaml.gotmpl` file for the wire-server chart at this nested level of the configuration:

```yaml
brig:
  # ...
  config:
    # ...
    optSettings:
      # ...
      setSearchSameTeamOnly: true
```

If `setSearchSameTeamOnly` is set to `true` then `TeamSearchVisibility` is forced be in the `SearchVisibilityNoNameOutsideTeam` setting for all teams.

### Changing the default configuration for all teams

If `setSearchSameTeamOnly` is set to `false`  (or missing from the configuration) then the default value `TeamSearchVisibility` can be configured at this level of the configuration of the `value.yaml.gotmpl` file of the wire-server chart:

```yaml
galley:
  #...
  config:
    #...
    settings:
      #...
      featureFlags:
        #...
        teamSearchVisibility: enabled-by-default
```

This default value applies to all teams for which no explicit configuration of the `TeamSearchVisibility` has been set.

## Searching users on another (federated) backend

For federated search the table above does not apply, see following table.

```{note}
Incoming federated searches (i.e. searches from one backend to another) are considered always as being performed from a team user, even if they are performed from a personal user.

This is because the incoming search request does not carry the information whether the user performing the search was in a team or not.

So we have to make one assumption, and we assume that they were in a team.
```

Allowing search is done at the backend configuration level by the sysadmin:

- Outbound search restrictions (`searchSameTeamOnly`, `TeamSearchVisibility`) do not apply to federated searches

- A configuration setting `FederatedUserSearchPolicy` per federating domain with these possible values:

  - `no_search` The federating backend is not allowed to search any users (either by exact handle or full-text).
  - `exact_handle_search` The federating backend may only search by exact handle
  - `full_search` The federating backend may search users by full text search on display name and handle. The search search results are additionally affected by `SearchVisibilityInbound` setting of each team on the backend.

- The `SearchVisibilityInbound` setting applies. Since the default value for teams is `SearchableByOwnTeam` this means that for a team to be full-text searchable by users on a federating backend both

  - `FederatedUserSearchPolicy` needs to be set to to full_search for the federating backend
  - Any team that wants to be full-text searchable needs to be set to `SearchableByAllTeams`

The configuration value `FederatedUserSearchPolicy` is per federated domain, e.g. in the values of the wire-server chart:

```yaml
brig:
  config:
    optSettings:
      setFederationDomainConfigs:
        - domain: a.example.com
          search_policy: no_search
        - domain: a.example.com
          search_policy: full_search
```

### Table of possible outcomes

In the following table, user `uA` on backend A is searching for user `uB` on team `tB` on backend B.

Any of the flags set for searching users on the same backend are ignored.

Itâ€™s worth nothing that if two users are on two separate backend, they are also guaranteed to be on two separate teams, as teams can not spread across backends.

| Who is searching       | Backend B flag `FederatedUserSearchPolicy` | Team `tB`'s flag `SearchVisibilityInbound` | Result of exact search for `uB` | Result of full-text search for `uB` |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| user `uA` on backend A | `no_search`                                | Irrelevant                                 | Not found                       | Not found                           |
| user `uA` on backend A | `exact_handle_search`                      | Irrelevant                                 | Found                           | Not found                           |
| user `uA` on backend A | `full_search`                              | SearchableByOwnTeam                        | Found                           | Not found                           |
| user `uA` on backend A | `full_search`                              | SearchableByAllTeams                       | Found                           | Found                               |

## Changing the settings for a given team

If you need to change searchabilility for a specific team (rather than the entire backend, as above), you need to make specific calls to the API.

### Team searchVisibility

The team flag `searchVisibility` affects the outbound search of user searches.

If it is set to `no-name-outside-team` for a team then all users of that team will no longer be able to find users that are not part of their team when searching.

This also includes finding other users by by providing their exact handle. By default it is set to `standard`, which doesn't put any additional restrictions to outbound searches.

The setting can be changed via endpoint (for more details on how to make the API calls with `curl`, read further):

```
GET /teams/{tid}/search-visibility
  -- Shows the current TeamSearchVisibility value for the given team

PUT /teams/{tid}/search-visibility
  -- Set specific search visibility for the team

pull-down-menu "body":
  "standard"
  "no-name-outside-team"
```

The team feature flag `teamSearchVisibility` determines whether it is allowed to change the `searchVisibility` setting or not.

The default is `disabled-by-default`.

```{note}
Whenever this feature setting is disabled the `searchVisibility` will be reset to standard.
```

The default setting that applies to all teams on the instance can be defined at configuration

```yaml
settings:
  featureFlags:
    teamSearchVisibility: disabled-by-default # or enabled-by-default
```

### TeamFeature searchVisibilityInbound

The team feature flag `searchVisibilityInbound` affects if the team's users are searchable by users from other teams.

The default setting is `searchable-by-own-team` which hides users from search results by users from other teams.

If it is set to `searchable-by-all-teams` then users of this team may be included in the results of search queries by other users.

```{note}
The configuration of this flag does not affect search results when the search query matches the handle exactly.

If the handle is provdided then any user on the instance can find users.
```

This team feature flag can only by toggled by site-administrators with direct access to the galley instance (for more details on how to make the API calls with `curl`, read further):

```
PUT /i/teams/{tid}/features/search-visibility-inbound
```

With JSON body:

```json
{"status": "enabled"}
```

or

```json
{"status": "disabled"}
```

Where `enabled` is equivalent to `searchable-by-all-teams` and `disabled` is equivalent to `searchable-by-own-team`.

The default setting that applies to all teams on the instance can be defined at configuration.

```yaml
searchVisibilityInbound:
  defaults:
    status: enabled # OR disabled
```

Individual teams can overwrite the default setting with APIÂ calls as per above.

### Making the API calls

To make API calls to set an explicit configuration for\` TeamSearchVisibilityInbound\` per team, you first need to know the Team ID, which can be found in the team settings app.

It is an `UUID<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>` which has format like this  `dcbedf9a-af2a-4f43-9fd5-525953a919e1`.

In the following we will be using this Team ID as an example, please replace it with your own team id.

Next find the name of a `galley` pod by looking at the output of running this command:

```sh
kubectl -n wire get pods
```

The output will look something like this:

```
...
galley-5f4787fdc7-9l64n   ...
galley-migrate-data-lzz5j ...
...
```

Select any of the galley pods, for example we will use `galley-5f4787fdc7-9l64n`.

Next, set up a port-forwarding from your local machine's port `9000` to the galley's port `8080` by running:

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n wire galley-5f4787fdc7-9l64n 9000:8080
```

Keep this command running until the end of these instuctions.

Please run the following commands in a seperate terminal while keeping the terminal which establishes the port-forwarding open.

To see team's current setting run:

```sh
curl -XGET http://localhost:9000/i/teams/dcbedf9a-af2a-4f43-9fd5-525953a919e1/features/searchVisibilityInbound

# {"lockStatus":"unlocked","status":"disabled"}
```

Where `disabled` corresponds to `SearchableByOwnTeam` and enabled corresponds to `SearchableByAllTeams`.

To change the `TeamSearchVisibilityInbound` to `SearchableByAllTeams` for the team run:

```sh
curl -XPUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"status\": \"enabled\"}" http://localhost:9000/i/teams/dcbedf9a-af2a-4f43-9fd5-525953a919e1/features/searchVisibilityInbound
```

To change the TeamSearchVisibilityInbound to SearchableByOwnTeam for the team run:

```sh
curl -XPUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"status\": \"disabled\"}" http://localhost:9000/i/teams/dcbedf9a-af2a-4f43-9fd5-525953a919e1/features/searchVisibilityInbound
```
