Swagger API documentation (all public endpoints)
================================================

Our staging system provides swagger documentation of our public rest
API.

We are currently (as of 2021-09-29) migrating our documentation into a
new system that is automatically checked for correctness. The old
documentation still has some endpoints, but the new one is getting more and more complete. We will completely replace the old one eventually.

Please check the new docs first, and if you can't find what you're
looking for, double-check the old.

New docs
--------

These docs show swagger 2.0:

`new staging swagger page <https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io/api/swagger-ui/>`_


Old docs
--------

Some endpoints are only shown using swagger 1.2.

At the time of writing, both swagger version 1.2 and version 2.0 are in use. If you are an employee of Wire, you can log in here and try out requests in the browser; if not, you can make use of the "List Operations" button on both 1.2 and 2.0 pages to see the possible API requests.

Browse to our `old staging swagger page <https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io/swagger-ui/>`_ to see rendered swagger documentation for the remaining endpoints.
