Wire-server API documentation
=============================

The following documentation provides information for, and takes the perspective of a Wire client developer. (wire-desktop, wire-android and wire-ios are examples of Wire Clients). This means only publicly accessible endpoints are mentioned.

.. warning::
   This section of the documentation is very incomplete at the time of writing (summer 2020) - more pages on the client API will follow in the future.
