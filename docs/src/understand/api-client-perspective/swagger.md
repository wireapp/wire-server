# Swagger API documentation (all public endpoints)

Our staging system provides swagger documentation of our public rest
API.

The swagger docs are correct by construction (compiled from the server
code), and the are complete up to bots/services and event notification
payloads (as of 2023-01-16).

Please check the new docs first, and if you can't find what you're
looking for, double-check the old.
