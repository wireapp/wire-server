# Swagger API documentation (all public endpoints)

Our staging system provides swagger documentation of our public rest
API.

The swagger docs are correct by construction (compiled from the server
code), and the are complete up to bots/services and event notification
payloads (as of 2023-01-16).

Please check the new docs first, and if you can't find what you're
looking for, double-check the old.

## New docs (swagger 2.0)

[new staging swagger page](https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io/api/swagger-ui/)

## Old docs (swagger 1.2)

If you are an employee of Wire, you can log in here and try out requests in the browser; if not, you can make use of the "List Operations" button on both 1.2 and 2.0 pages to see the possible API requests.

Browse to our [old staging swagger page](https://staging-nginz-https.zinfra.io/swagger-ui/) to see rendered swagger documentation for the remaining endpoints.
