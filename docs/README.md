# /docs 

- This directory contains only files that have been modified within the past year (since February 19, 2025). All older files have been moved to the [wire-docs](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-docs) repository. 

- These files are included in the wire-docs repository as a submodule and are pulled during the build process. They are essential for constructing the complete Wire documentation site. Any changes to these files should be made here, while updates to the older files (not present here anymore) should be committed directly to the wire-docs repository.
