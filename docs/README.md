# /docs 
- This directory contains only files that have been modified within the last year (since 19/02/25); all other files have been moved to the [wire-docs](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-docs) repository. The files in this directory are used when building the full wire documentation site, so any changes to these files should be updated here, while updates to the other files should be committed directly to the wire-docs repository.
