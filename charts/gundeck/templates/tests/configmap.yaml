      # some gundeck integration tests make use of two different
      # cannon instances to test the distributed case.  when running
      # the integration tests locally, the two instances will be spun
      # up separately (see `wire-server/services/integration.sh`).
      #
      # here, we spin up two replicas, provide the integration tests
      # with the same service coordinates, and rely on the k8s load
      # balancer to give us both replicas in at least some cases.
      # this would be enough to make the test meaningful.
      #
      # alternatively (eg. if we have more involved integration tests
      # that expect ca and ca2 to deterministically refer to specific
      # replicas), we could enter the IP addresses of the replicas
      # here.  those are available from `kubectl get endpoints`, but
      # how do we inject that info into the config file on time for
      # the gundeck integration tests to find them there?
