# The following defaults apply to a cloud-like setup (in which you can ask your
# kubernetes installation to give you a LoadBalancer setup).
#
# If you are on bare metal and wish an installation similiar in spirit as the
# older similarly named wrapper chart 'nginx-ingress-controller' (note the
# swapped words 'nginx' and 'ingress'), where we assume no load balancer support
# and instead expose NodePorts on ports 31773 and 31772, and where you need to
# ensure traffic gets to these ports in another way; then please read the
# documentation on https://docs.wire.com/how-to/install/ingress.html (or go to
# https://docs.wire.com and search for "ingress-nginx-controller")
#
# See
# https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/charts/ingress-nginx/values.yaml
# for all possible values to override.

    # LoadBalancer)

    service:
      type: LoadBalancer  # or NodePort (then also use DaemonSet)
      # set externalTrafficPolicy=Local to keep the source IP available in
      # upstream services. Comes with tradeoff considerations, see
      # documentation on "ingress" on docs.wire.com
      externalTrafficPolicy: Local
      nodePorts:
        # If you set service.type = NodePort, then the nginx controller instance
        # is exposed on ports 31773 (https) and 31772 (http) on the node on
        # which it runs. You should add a port-forwarding rule on the node or on
        # the loadbalancer that forwards ports 443 and 80 to these respective
        # ports.
