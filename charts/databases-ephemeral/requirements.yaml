## dependent (demo, non-persistent, non-HA) databases
#
# Note: why are these charts not part of the wire-server chart?
# These charts, in particular cassandra/elasticsearch
# cannot be part of the wire-server chart, because of the required ordering of
# 1. install databases, wait for them to be ready
# 2. run database cassandra-migrations (done as a pre-install/pre-upgrade hook)
# 3. install wire-server
# I.e. cassandra-migrations cannot run before databases are ready, so one cannot make them a pre-install/upgrade hook. Making them a post-install hook also doesn't work:
# Installing all charts in parallel means brig/galley/gundeck won't start up
# since cassandra-migrations did not yet run; but the cassandra-migrations hook
# requires all pods to be in a 'Ready' state before starting (condition for post-install); this is impossible.
