You now have an in-memory, non-persistent, non-highly-available set of databases:

* cassandra-ephemeral
* elasticsearch-ephemeral
* redis-ephemeral

!! WARNING WARNING !!
This is fine for testing and demo purposes, but NOT for a production use case.
!! WARNING WARNING !!

Note that before use of these databases for wire-server components, an index (in the case of elasticsearch) and a set of cassandra-migrations (in the case of cassandra) have to be applied. This comes bundled with the wire-server chart (see cassandra-migrations and elasticsearch-index charts for details)
