# This chart optionally supports waiting for traffic to drain from coturn

# incoming client traffic away from itself on its own, so this functionality
# relies on external traffic management (e.g. service discovery for active coturn
# instances) to prevent clients from sending new requests to pods which are in a
# terminating state.
