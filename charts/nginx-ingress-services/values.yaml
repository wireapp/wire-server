# If you want to use TLS termination on the ingress,
# then set this variable to true and ensure that there
# is a valid wildcard TLS certificate
# When TLS is enable, ensure that you have the certificate
# and secret in a file under helm_vars/bare/secret.yaml (or
# another location) since enabling TLS requires you to supply
# a `tlsWildcardCert` and `tlsWildcardKey` (these will then be
# 64 encoded as part of the secret creation) so those values
# should simply contain the certificate and key (you can also
# encrypt them with sops and use helm-wrapper, check README.md
# for an example)
tls:
  enabled: true
  # NOTE:
  #  (1) enables automated certificate renewal provided by https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager
  #  (2) supersedes wildcard certificate configuration mentioned above
  # IMPORTANT: requires cert-manager to be installed on the cluster beforehand, e.g.
  #            `helm upgrade --install -n cert-manager-ns --set 'installCRDs=true' cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager`

certManager:
  # Indicates whether Letsencrypt's staging API server is used and therefore certificates are NOT trusted
  # default: production API server is used and certificates are trusted
  inTestMode: false
  # NOTE:
  #  (1) required to be set in values.yaml
  #  (2) used by Letsencrypt to send expiration notices and alike
