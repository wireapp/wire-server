    # TODO: Add TURN tests once we have an actual way to test it
    # The brig-integration tests mutate the turn settings files before tests
    # to get certain behaviour. This doesn't work on kubernetes because brig
    # is a different pod than brig-integration and they can't both mouht the
    # same file-system.
    # The other test, "user.auth.cookies.limit", is skipped as it is flaky.
    # This is tracked in https://github.com/zinfra/backend-issues/issues/1150.
