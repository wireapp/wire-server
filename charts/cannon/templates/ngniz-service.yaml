# This service has to be exposed using type `LoadBalancer` to ensure that there
# is no other pod between the load balancer and this service. This ensures that
# only thing which disrupts the websocket connection is when a cannon pod gets
# stopped. If, like other services we have a separate nginz and an
# ingress-controller between the load balancer and the service, stopping any of
# these pods would cause websockets to be disrupted.
