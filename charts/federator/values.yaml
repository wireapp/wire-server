    # Defaults to using system CA store in the federator image for making
    # connections to remote federators.
    # A custom CA certificate can be provided by specifying
    #   federator.remoteCAContents
    # e.g. from a pem file myca.pem:
    #   { echo "federator:"; echo "  remoteCAContents: |"; sed -e 's/^/    /' myca.pem; } > myca.yaml
    # then use '-f myca.yaml' as additional flag to your helm commands.
    #
    # Using custom CA doesn't automatically disable system CA store, it should
    # be disabled explicitly by setting useSystemCAStore to false.
