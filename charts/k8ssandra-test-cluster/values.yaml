# stored. Storage is automatically requested if the storage class is correctly
# setup.
storageClassName: hcloud-volumes-encrypted

# storageSize: Size of the storage (persistent volume claim) to request. At
# Hetzner's cloud the smallest volume is 10GB. So, even if you need much less
# storage, it's fine to request 10GB. The memory units are described here:

storageSize: 10G
