# Produces final docker image with a single executable $executable

# Requires docker version >= 17.05 (requires support for multi-stage builds)
# Requires to have created the wire-server-builder and wire-server-deps docker images (run `make` in this directory)
# Usage example:
#   (from wire-server root directory)
#   export EXECUTABLE=galley-schema; docker build -t $EXECUTABLE -f build/alpine/Dockerfile.executable --build-arg executable=$EXECUTABLE .

ARG intermediate=wireserver/intermediate
ARG deps=wireserver/alpine-deps

#--- Intermediate stage ---
FROM ${intermediate} as intermediate

#--- Minified stage ---
FROM ${deps}

ARG executable

COPY --from=intermediate /dist/${executable} /dist/${executable}

# TODO: only if executable=brig, also copy templates. Docker image conditionals seem hacky:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31528384/conditional-copy-add-in-dockerfile
# For now, adds ~2 MB of additional files into every container
COPY --from=intermediate /dist/templates/ /usr/share/wire/templates/

# ARGs are not available at runtime, create symlink at build time

RUN ln -s /usr/bin/${executable} /usr/bin/service
