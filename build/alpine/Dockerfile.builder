# We do a full 'stack build' to get dependencies like 'aws' to build, but then
# we do a 'stack clean' so that packages in the repo wouldn't get into the final
# image â€“ that's because Stack sometimes doesn't realize that local packages
# should be recompiled, and we really don't want that to happen during CI.
