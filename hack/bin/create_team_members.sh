USAGE="
This bash script can be used to invite members to a given team.  Input
is a csv file with email addresses and suggested user names.

Note that this uses internal brig endpoints.  It is not exposed over
nginz and can only be used if you have direct access to brig.

USAGE: $0
    -a <admin uuid>: User ID of the inviting admin.  default: ${ADMIN_UUID}
    -t <team uuid>: ID of the inviting team.  default: ${TEAM_UUID}
    -h <host>: Base URI of brig. default: ${BRIG_HOST}
    -c <input file>: file containing info on the invitees in format 'Email,UserName,Role'.  default: ${CSV_FILE}

If role is specified, it must be one of owner, admin, member, partner.
If it is missing, default is member.

If you tee(1) stdout, stderr of this script into a log file, you can
grep that log file for errors like this:

$ grep code out.log | grep email-exists  # the most common case
$ grep code out.log | grep -v email-exists

If you are in a hurry, you may want to change the sleep(1) at the end
of the invite loop to less than a second.  If you want to give up on
the first error, add an exit(1) where we check the $INVIDATION_ID.
