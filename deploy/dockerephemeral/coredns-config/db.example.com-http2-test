; This host address is from the TEST-NET-1 block, and is never routable. Thus, it is a perfect "bad" ip address
; hyphenhyphen.net is controlled by Owen Harvey, but I recommend that one of the following actions is taken.
; The IP address should be 192.0.2.1
; 1 - Setup a similar domain on wire.com, or a testing domain, with the same or similar IP address.
; 2 - Rework `federator` so that it uses the DNS setup for all of the host lookups it performs.
; 3 - Rework how integration tests are run, so that they see the CoreDNS docker container as the default
;     DNS resolver, side-stepping having to add a known-bad IP to other resolvers.
