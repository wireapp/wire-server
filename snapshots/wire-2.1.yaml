packages:
# amazonka-1.6.1 is buggy: https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues/466
# Therefore we pin an unreleased commit directly.
#
# More precisely, we pull just some libraries out of it,
# the other packages weren't changed between 1.6.1 and this commit,
# so we can use Stackage-supplied versions for them.
# See https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/compare/1.6.1...9cf5b5777b69ac494d23d43a692294882927df34
#
# Once there has been made a new hackage release, we can use that instead.
