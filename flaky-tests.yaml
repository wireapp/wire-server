    I think this is a known flake (Stefan)

    Exception: Timeout: No matching notification received.
    Match failure: expected: Just "user.delete"
     but got: Just "conversation.delete"

    2023-03-24: The test has multiple "user.delete" assertions, but since there
                is a "conversation.delete" event I think it must be the one
                generated by the team deletion. This would also explain why it
                might take longer for the event to happen than in other cases.
                I've increased the timeout from 4 to 7 seconds for that one
                assertion. Let's see if this helps.

    /bin/sh: createProcess: posix_spawnp: failed (Bad address)
    This is probably to resource exhaustion.
    Can we try increasing limits?

    Exception: unexpected notification received
    Match failure: expected: no notification
     but got: "conversation.create"

    2023-03-24: The test is not waiting for notifications triggered by creating
                conversations. When later asserting that no notification is sent
                for deleting conversations, the test fails under load when the
                create conversation notification happens to come in late. This
                is fixed by waiting for all previous notifications before
                asserting the absence of (new) notifications.

    2023-03-27: Hopefully fix by increasing timeout from 10 to 15 seconds for this test.
