    I think this is a known flake (Stefan)

    Exception: Timeout: No matching notification received.
    Match failure: expected: Just "user.delete"
     but got: Just "conversation.delete"

    2023-03-24: The test has multiple "user.delete" assertions, but since there
                is a "conversation.delete" event I think it must be the one
                generated by the team deletion. This would also explain why it
                might take longer for the event to happen than in other cases.
                I've increased the timeout from 4 to 7 seconds for that one
                assertion. Let's see if this helps.

      Alls three runs: on 2023-03-21- 2023-03-22 failed with
      Error executing request: /bin/sh: createProcess: posix_spawnp: failed (Bad address)
      It's present on the mls and 4.34.0-hotfix branch, so I'm assuming it's also present on develop.
