* [ ] I have seen https://docs.wire.com/ and https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server-deploy - the documentation there does not answer my question.

## My question:

## Context:

> Please provide sufficent context about your problem:

### How did you install wire-server?

> On kubernetes? With docker-compose? by manually compiling and running?

### How many servers are involved?

### What is installed on which servers?

> E.g Server A has component X and server B has component Y

### Provide details about networking

> We don't need to know any specific IP address, but it helps if you provide information whether an IP is ipv4 or ipv6, whether is is publicly reachable from the global internet or not, and if you installed any component of wire-server, which network interfaces are processes listening on?

### How did you configure wire-server?

> *Note: only the configuration from helm charts in wire-server-deploy is what we support, like [these defaults](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server-deploy/blob/develop/charts/brig/values.yaml) applied [here](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server-deploy/blob/develop/charts/brig/templates/configmap.yaml) in the case of `brig`. If you have used other configuration files, please post them (or the relevant parts of them).*
> Did you use the helm charts from wire-server-deploy?
> Did you use and adapt configuration files from wire-server? If so, which ones?
> Are there any overrides?
